the secondary port of a NanoStation. Add to /etc/rc.local on the node:

echo 8 > /sys/class/gpio/export
echo out > /sys/class/gpio/gpio8/direction
echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio8/value

There should also be an 'exit 0' at the end of the file, after these
commands. You can add these commands in and then run /etc/rc.local, or
reboot the node.

I got these instructions from Josh King.

How much autodetection behaviour will be irrelevant or bypassed with the
new Quickstart process?

For example, if I select that I don't want to share my bandwidth, will
it turn the DHCP client off on the Ethernet port? Or is there other
behaviour that will be pre-empted by the generated or uploaded
configurations?

80,Commotion-admin, [Commotion-OpenWRT - Feature #447] (Feedback),"Mon, 04 Mar 2013 11:50:14 -0500",-0500,Josh King,"Hi Andy,

The bandwidth thing is not in DR1, but it is a high-priority 
development task immediately after. It will not turn off DHCP, it will 
just change the routing so that it is not routed as a gateway. There is 
already a package that does this, freifunk-policyrouting, but it's not 
as sophisticated as we would like (it lets you decide not to share your 
bandwidth, it doesn't allow you to decide to share some of it).

DR1 will have the same (but better, in that it should detect cable 
plugs and not just work on boot) DHCP lease detection on wired 
interfaces.

145,Commotion-admin, [Commotion Wireless - Support #403] Improve,"Thu, 18 Apr 2013 23:54:33 -0000",-0000,Ben West,"Hi All,

I'm responding to this notification email directly, since Preston's
(lengthy!) update to issue #430 doesn't seem to have been posted on redmine.

Some questions to better understand the physical mesh topology:

1. Preston mentioned the node 'RHI Wifi 3' daisy-chaining power to node
'RHI Wifi.'  Assuming Wifi 3 is a Nanostation M2, are you using the 1amp
POE injector?  Please note the 0.5amp POE injectors normally included with
Nanostations can not supply enough current for 2 devices; you have to buy
the large 1amp injector.

2. I believe the Commotion-OpenWRT PR3 firmware, which I'm assuming both of
these nodes are running, normally just bridges the secondary LAN of a
Nanostation with the encrypted, private AP.  I don't believe the firmware
will correctly route over a direct wired link between 2 nodes; it assumes
nodes only mesh with each other wirelessly.  Did you make any custom
firewall / routing config changes to acknowledge this wired link?  Without
any custom config, daisy-chaining the 2 nodes like this may be causing
redundant / confused routes.

3. Instead of having RHI Wifi draw power from the 2nd LAN port on RHI Wifi
3, could you see how things work with RHI Wifi powered independently?

4. Assuming these two RHI nodes are broadcasting on the same channel, how
far apart are they spaced physically?  If they're very close together and
running at full TX power, possibly they're interfering?

5. Have you yet tried upgrading these nodes to DR1?

Blocking port 80 connections from WAN zone makes it difficult to administer a network where nodes are plugged into a LAN that also has a gateway.

Looks like there are a bunch of IPv6 related changed being backported into AA right now, and I'll venture a guess that is relevant to this issue.

Here is the URL for browsing changesets to current AA:
https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/branches/attitude_adjustment

... versus the URL for commits made to the tag 'attitude_adjustment_12.09':
https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/tags/attitude_adjustment_12.09

Unfortunately, it does look like using the tag means you get no updates at all until the OpenWRT dev team makes another stable release (i.e. circa 2015).  And it doesn't appear the OpenWRT git repos using any tagging at all.  Likewise, less chance of bisecting the root cause.

Would pinning the feeds.conf file to specific revisions of AA be more appealing?

I have r36969 I can try out here, to see if it is affected by this issue.

I believe the old open source b43 driver has working adhoc mode.  And I think
some broadcom drivers do support adhoc somewhat, but some definitely do not
have any usable support.

This is definitely not an issue in commotion-mesh-applet.  NetworkManager
tries to handle it somewhat, but its not easy to do even there, where its a
more natural place for it.

to test:
1) create a service w/ web interface, where service IP address is 127.0.0.1 and Port field is blank. You should see a file in /etc/avahi/services/ called 127_460_460_461.service.
2) Log in as admin, and edit the service in the web interface. Add &#39;80&#39; to the Port field, and click submit. In the /etc/avahi/services directory, the old file 127_460_460_461.service should no longer be there, and 127_460_460_46180.service should be there instead.

Andrew mentioned that it would encourage weak passwords, since the password would have to be shared and manually entered into every mesh node that is set up, and I would agree with that reasoning.

I think a better approach would be, instead of having the user change default values on the quickstart, there should be another notification for the admin *after* quickstart that the node is using default values and should change them. These values should be changed manually on one node, then shared with the others strictly through exported profile files. The profile file would include, among other settings, the mesh password and the serval keyring used for olsrd-mdp. We could even have the node randomly generate a strong mesh password (though the PRNG on the routers is of dubioius entropy).

363,Commotion-admin, [commotion-quick-start] Mesh password (#27),"Tue, 20 Aug 2013 14:00:24 -0700",-0700,Ben West,"I fully understand that providing a field where users could enter ""password"" as their password value will invariably lead to instances where users do actually enter ""password,"" regardless of any bolded warning text on the form, or even javascript nags.  That is just human nature.

However, not providing this field at all does still ultimately limit the UI, perhaps needlessly.  Image you're needing to flash a new node to participate in an existing mesh (which has an existing, secure mesh password).  Being able to paste that password into the new node's quick start form would make this task very easy.

Suggested alternative: provide a form input for the mesh/adhoc password, but have it pre-populated with a reasonably long string of random chars, up to 63chars long.  This string doesn't have to be (pseudo) randomly generated; since you would still like for a collection of newly flashed nodes to still mesh together right away.  Put a brief description under the field explaining the password's purpose, including that only the nodes need to know this password internally.  No human should need to use the mesh password (besides during initial quick start).

to test:
1) create a service w/ web interface, where service IP address is 127.0.0.1 and Port field is blank, and a TTL &gt; 0. You should see a file in /etc/avahi/services/ called 127_460_460_461.service.
2) Log in as admin, and edit the service in the web interface. Add &#39;80&#39; to the Port field, and click submit. In the /etc/avahi/services directory, the old file 127_460_460_461.service should no longer be there, and 127_460_460_46180.service should be there instead.

users of the node to add local application URLs using Application
Portal. Parameters passed to this form are moderately sanitized
against XSS attacks. Some of the parameters (ipaddr and port) are then
used to execute OS command checking if the submitted app is available
using luci.sys.exec:

https://github.com/opentechinstitute/commotion-apps/blob/29f28511ca48cfdb208096c5e2426e06312689e2/lua/luci/controller/commotion/apps_controller.lua#L320-L340

If URL was submitted instead of IP address (that is, if sent value
does not match IP address syntax), protocol part of ipaddr value is
removed and the value is truncated on first : or / character (to
remove port/path). Before that though, initial sanitization routine
encodes the following characters: <>&\r\n? with html_encode helper
function:

https://github.com/opentechinstitute/commotion-apps/blob/29f28511ca48cfdb208096c5e2426e06312689e2/lua/luci/controller/commotion/apps_controller.lua#L292-L299

https://github.com/opentechinstitute/luci-commotion/blob/9acaeb04fe337da6b4059096a74eae7807182994/luasrc/commotion_helpers.lua

Such moderately transformed value is being passed to OS command
execution routine. By manipulating ipaddr parameter attacker can
execute arbitrary OS commands.

No CSRF tokens are needed to submit such a request. Users of the
commotion node could execute arbitrary OS commands with root
privileges on the device unknowingly just by visiting a website with
prepared payload.

Further investigation shows that the similar vulnerability was already
reported as fixed - https://code.commotionwireless.net/issues/548.
However, as demonstrated, new bypasses are still possible, and it?s
recommended to perform the strict input validation (e.g. allowing only
alphanumeric characters plus a chosen known-safe characters, depending
on the context).

However, successful exploitation requires victim to use an outdated browser, as well as disable friendly HTTP error messages (which is a default setting), therefore the impact of this vulnerability is limited.

port scan is successful, application is added to the pool and is later
visible to other node users. Optionally administrator can approve the
application on admin/commotion/apps page.

It is possible to inject javascript code as an application URL, such
that it will still pass the port scanning check.

This can be used e.g. to trick Node administrator into clicking on application link and taking over CSRF token and session ID to hijack administrative session. As original form to add application does not require authentication or Anti CSRF tokens, the attack can be effectively performed from the Internet by enticing Commotion node
users to visit a certain malicious page.

482,Commotion-admin, [commotion-openwrt] Remove CSRF token from,"Wed, 11 Sep 2013 09:13:22 -0700",-0700,areynold,"**FINDING ID:** iSEC-COMMO13-2

**TARGETS:** The stok Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) token placed within the site URL such as:
http://103.3.0.1/cgi-bin/luci/;stok=60894104183094a30c6967cfc9d4fabc/admin/

**DESCRIPTION:** The application uses a random stok parameter as a form of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection. This token is stored within the URL and remains static for each admin session. As the token is stored within the URL, it may be leaked within HTTP or Proxy logs and referrer headers.

In addition to possible exposure risks, unauthenticated mesh users can specify applications, which allows a malicious user to directly leak the CSRF token via referer header to a specific host. When the administrator visits the list of pages, their token is exposed as demonstrated in the following example:
GET /icon.png HTTP/1.1
Host: www.isecpartners.com
Referer: http://103.3.0.1/cgi-bin/luci/;stok=b434bc654cc0056d5572e816d881d83b/admin/
commotion/apps
Connection: keep-alive

**EXPLOIT SCENARIO:** An attacker can add an application, setting the host icon to a malicious site. When a Commotion administrator logs in and views their local applications, their browser automatically sends a GET request for the application icon which will include their CSRF token in the referer header. An attacker may be able to leverage this to perform a CSRF attack, made worse by the fact that the current administrator password is not required to set a new value. 

This additionally may expose the location and CSRF tokens to third parties such as luci.subsignal.org (shown below). While it is unlikely this host is malicious, this may be called out in a review of the application or if further third parties may be integrated.

**SHORT TERM SOLUTION:** Investigate methods of moving the CSRF protection into an HTTP Header and using per-form POST values. Additionally, requiring the current administrator password for any sensitive actions can provide a defense in depth against CSRF attacks.

**LONG TERM SOLUTION:** Consider methods for improving the security of anonymous local-application additions or default to disallowing local application functionality unless enabled by an administrator. This may contribute to a stronger default security posture and reduce the ""out of box"" attack surface.

"
483,Commotion-admin, [commotion-openwrt] Missing HTTPOnly Flag for,"Wed, 11 Sep 2013 09:22:51 -0700",-0700,areynold,"**FINDING ID:** iSEC-COMMO13-4

**TARGETS:** The lack of an HTTPOnly flag on the sysauth administrative session cookie.

**DESCRIPTION:** Cookies set by the administrative application are not protected by the HTTPOnly flag. This flag indicates to modern browsers the session token cannot be accessed via JavaScript. When set by the web application, this provides excellent defense in depth against session hijacking via Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**EXPLOIT SCENARIO:** An attacker locates an XSS vulnerability within the application and uses it to perform trivial admin session hijacking. The attacker then performs operations on the administrators behalf such as changing the current password (which does not require the current password) in addition to a number of other sensitive actions.

**SHORT TERM SOLUTION:** Use a documented method within LuCI to set the HTTPOnly flag (if it exists) or apply the flag when setting the sysauth cookie via luci.http.header.

**LONG TERM SOLUTION:** Review the Commotion web applications and attack surface for standard web application best practices (check https://www.owasp.org for resources). Consider implementing a regression test to ensure this issue does not resurface in future releases once fixed.

"
484,Commotion-admin, [commotion-openwrt] Missing Secure Flag for,"Wed, 11 Sep 2013 09:25:11 -0700",-0700,areynold,"**FINDING ID:** iSEC-COMMO13-5

**TARGETS:** The lack of a Secure flag on the sysauth administrative session cookie.

**DESCRIPTION:** The Secure flag, when set by the web application for modern browsers, indicates the session cookie should never be sent via a plaintext HTTP connection. This can offer defense in depth against network attacks when the application or administrative portions of the Commotion router uses HTTPS.

**EXPLOIT SCENARIO:** An attacker may be able to cause the sysauth cookie to be leaked via a plaintext HTTP request. In one example, an attacker could create a plaintext HTTP link to the Commotion router as a local application icon. If an administrator is authenticated to the site over SSL and visits the application list, the browser will issue the plaintext, non-SSL request and automatically include the admin's current session token. A network attacker may be able to capture this value via network sniffing and perform subsequent actions on the administrator's behalf.

**SHORT TERM SOLUTION:** Use a documented method within LuCI to set the secure flag if it exists or apply the flag when setting the sysauth cookie via luci.http.header.

**LONG TERM SOLUTION:** Ensure the default administrative interface uses HTTPS via TLS and does not accept plaintext connections. Review the Commotion web applications and attack surface for standard web application best practices. Consider implementing a regression test to ensure this issue does not resurface in future releases once fixed.

"
485,Commotion-admin, [olsrd] OLSRd Provides Network Exposed Attack,"Wed, 11 Sep 2013 09:28:31 -0700",-0700,areynold,"**FINDING ID:** iSEC-COMMO13-9

**TARGETS:** OLSRd daemons listening on all interfaces and running as the root user:
* http://192.168.1.20:1978/
* http://192.168.1.20:9090/
* http://192.168.1.20:2006/

**DESCRIPTION:** The services listed above provide unauthenticated access to sensitive internal state of the OLSRd daemon. These daemons also expose HTTP interfaces and run as the root user. This attack surface and information is accessible to unauthenticated users (who are able to gain access to the network). If they are not required for end use, they should be listening only on localhost, disabled or firewalled.

**EXPLOIT SCENARIO:** An attacker connects to the public wireless interface running on a commotion router. He port scans the router and discovers the above services. He downloads the OLSRd configuration and uses the information contained within to perform directed attacks.

**SHORT TERM SOLUTION:** Disable the above services.
**LONG TERM SOLUTION:** Configure an end-host firewall to block access to all ports except those explicitly required for functionality. Port scan routers as a part of a regression test to identify wayward services that have been left running.

486,Commotion-admin, [commotion-openwrt] Extend ad-hoc security,"Wed, 11 Sep 2013 09:51:47 -0700",-0700,Ben West,"Would these tunnels be intended to transport all AP traffic from repeater nodes back to gateways, or just for select traffic?  If the former, I would recommend keeping an eye on the performance impact of enclosing AP traffic in encrypted tunnels, as the nodes only have 400MHz of CPU and 32MB of RAM.  Commotion-OpenWRT already uses significant RAM on the device, so there may be suboptimal memory left to support substantial tunnel traffic.

Also, the 24kc MIPS CPU on the ar71xx platform does provide limited hardware acceleration for SSL encryption in the openssl library, specifically SHA1, SHA256, and AES, if there are tunneling applications which use that.  This could substantially reduce the burden of such tunnels on the embedded CPU.

**TARGETS:** The Serval route signing key.

**DESCRIPTION:** The Serval route signing key is static across all Commotion instances. This provides no security, as anyone with the key can publish signed routes that all other routers will accept. The key can either be extracted from the firmware or downloaded on GitHub to be later leveraged by attackers.

Additionally, iSEC is unaware of a method within the web interface to change or rotate these keys. 

**EXPLOIT SCENARIO:** An attacker joins the backhaul wireless mesh network by brute forcing WEP. The attacker generates malicious OLSR route advertisements and signs them with the known secret key. The routers will identify the signature as valid and update their routing tables accordingly, allowing the malicious user to redirect traffic as he sees fit.

**SHORT TERM SOLUTION:** Several options:
* Allow a device administrator to change the key
* Use a key derivation function (KDF) 7 based on the network key

**LONG TERM SOLUTION: Handling secure key generation and distribution is a difficult problem with both technical and UI/UX challenges. Consider policies related to the security level of the router as described in commotion-openwrt issue 23

While both parameters have limited input validation, this only exists to check for the backtick character, not other forms of injection such as null (%00) or $.

**SHORT TERM SOLUTION:** Expand the existing input filtering to include other dangerous characters such as $ and ;. Only alpha-numeric names, nicknames and descriptions should be permitted. (This may be problematic for Unicode but the same general recommendation exists.)

**LONG TERM SOLUTION:** Avoid direct calls to high-risk LuCI shell functions such as luci.sys.exec and luci.sys.call. Instead, replace these with a call to a wrapper library which contains a secondary layer of input validation.

This fact constitutes an issue in and of itself, but it has become show-stoppingly problematic with the introduction of the forced-redirect to https for all  administrative panels.  At least in Firefox, the browser will allow the https connection to the first device with the standard cert warning - but attempting to connect to any other devices will result in an inescapable error (ie, one that does not let the user through, no matter what they do) indicating that the browser has seen the current cert fingerprint before, associated with a different device, and is hence unwilling to let a new device use it.

The problem is that when you permanently save the cert, your browser maps it to an IP address. If you primarily access the node through the 192.168.1.20 alias, rather than its LAN address, when you save the cert it gets associated with the 192.168.1.20 address. When you go to another node, it gets the same IP address but a different certificate (actually if it were the same cert, you wouldn't get this error at all), thus causing the error. This only occurs for users who primarily connect via the 192.168.1.20 alias rather than getting a DHCP lease. The solution is to change the 'thisnode' alias to point to the main LAN IP, and remove the 192.168.1.20 alias. The first part of the solution at least is in DR2. I'll leave this issue open in the meantime until DR2.1 changes the IP addressing, which will address the second part.

Since the splash screen is used to grant internet access to AP clients, a user requesting a secure webpage (e.g., https://google.com) will not be able to connect to the internet and may not receive any indication that they need to visit a non-SSL webpage first.

Some OS level tools attempt to work around this problem, which is common to all captive portals, but there is no real technical fix. This should be documented in the startup materials.

See https://github.com/opentechinstitute/commotion-openwrt/issues/32 and https://github.com/opentechinstitute/commotion-openwrt/issues/33 for the full issue writeups and pointers to resources.

In this case I'm not sure exactly what apps_controller is doing or how the cookie is being used, but the cookie construct is identical to luci's dispatcher.lua, which builds the sysauth cookie in commotion-openwrt (which triggered issues 32 and 33, above).

This would let you enable compressed swap memory on nodes, and ideally make the memory limit somewhat softer (i.e. help nodes avoid OOM errors and processes crashing).

So, specifically, do make kernel_menuconfig and make these selections:
General Setup -> Support for paging of anonymous memory (swap) *
Device Drivers -> Staging drivers -> Compressed RAM block device support *

This kernel config change can also be done via a patch, and such a patch is buried somewhere in openwrt-devel listserv archives (i.e. when the zram package was originally announced).

Then copy the zram_swap package from trunk into commotionfeed and enable it.

For my nodes with 32MB of RAM, I specify 6MB swap in /etc/config/system:

```
config system
	...
	option 'zram_size_mb' '6'
```

You can periodically check swap usage to ensure nothing is using excessive RAM:

```

             total         used         free       shared      buffers

This is despite seeing different values set explicitly in /etc/config/wireless, and it's been observed consistently enough to rule the possibility that nodes are simply retaining a txpower setting that was previously set via command line and not rebooted.  Likewise, I can confirm the ability to set different txpower settings on Nanonstation Loco M2 APs using another OpenWRT AA derivative of nearly identical vintage, indicated an issue specific to Picostations.

I'm filing this issue so that it doesn't get forgotten, and in case this becomes an issue to file upstream.

A possibly relevant, unresolved detail may be how Commotion-OpenWRT and/or its constituent modules could be made to work with alternate captive portals.  Genevieve has made progress with teasing commotion-splash (and thus nodog) out as a standalone module, but I can confirm many mesh networks use coovachilli (including WasabiNet) for their portal.  Unlike commotion-splash, coovachilli is largely self-contained, not dependent on lua or a separate http server.

So, could this effort to modularize portions of Commotion also work with firmware platforms that do not use Luci/lua for the captive portal?

- [ ] An assessment of existing network needs to create use-case documentation and test-suit types that are accurately split apart for teh varying use-cases and data required by community wireless projects to tune performance, show success', and better serve community needs.
- [ ] A system for a node to query nodes on the network for paired testing, like iperf tests.
- [ ] A system, and configuration interface, for nodes to evaluate their status before approving, putting off, or rejecting test requests from other nodes.
- [ ] A system for receiving and verifying requests from the dashboard for tests between a node and another end-point. This will allow dashboard controller to identify problem areas and query nodes around those areas to check connectivity, etc. to other nodes.
- [ ] Dashboard level features for requesting tests from nodes and viewing the results of tests over time
- [ ] A node level dashboard to show condensed overviews of tests run on a node in the past

(Was Bug 624 on code.commotionwireless.net)

This issue is in follow-up to #622 that was marked resolved yesterday.

The problem is that Commotion-OpenWRT build will fail with the following error if no level in serval-dna-batphone's path inside the build tree is a git repo:

make[4]: Entering directory `/blah/blah/commotion-openwrt/openwrt/build_dir/target-mips_uClibc-0.9.33.2/serval-dna-batphone-release-0.91'

make[1]: Leaving directory `/blah/blah/commotion-openwrt/openwrt'
make: *** [world] Error 2

This error occurs because /blah/blah/commotion-openwrt/openwrt/build_dir/target-mips_uClibc-0.9.33.2/serval-dna-batphone-release-0.91/Makefile runs the script version_string.sh in the same directory to generate a string representing the current revision.

This works for instances where the Commoption-OpenWRT codebase is itself cloned from github, as version_string.sh will then return ""DR2"", but really this approach is only working by coincidence. version_string.sh is likely expecting to retrieve the current git revision for serval-dna, and not for an unrelated repo in a higher up directory.

A possible resolution is to add a patch commotion/packages/serval-dna/patches to alter version_string.sh so that it doesn't expect a git repo in its current directory.

This is due to when the AP is disabled from the web interface, it adds a 'disabled' flag to the AP in /etc/config/wireless, then restarts the wifi interfaces. This has the effect of taking down wlan0-1 (the Ad-Hoc interface) and leaving wlan0 (the AP), the opposite of the intended effect. It also has the effect of creating an invalid olsrd config (via commotiond), and the wifi interfaces are displayed incorrectly in the web interface.

We changed it to 11, saved and applied, and although the menu records the channel as changed, Wi-Fi analyzer and iwconfig record it as still set to 5.

the node, upon bringing up its wireless interface, will always scan channels to see if there is a mesh to join, and it will join that mesh and set its channel to that mesh's channel regardless of the choice the user made. Thus far, it seems the workaround is to bring up the first node in a new mesh in the absence of any other mesh network, set its channel to the channel you want, then bring up the other nodes in its presence.""

For example:
Scrape jsoninfo to get info about the state of the connection, then change the applet icon accordingly. This should probably tap into the existing JsonInfo scrape that's happening, rather than having another json scrape.

There should probably something like 4 states. More might be confusing, but it can't just be on or off since mesh is cmore complicated than that. Perhaps something like:

781,Commotion-admin, [olsrd] Apparent OLSR sensitivity to node local,"Thu, 17 Oct 2013 06:06:52 -0700",-0700,areynold,"
I'm starting this as a separate thread, in case the problem also arises for the folks testing on Android.

I've found that if a repeater node boots up with its local time grossly out of sync (ath5k devices especially), and it is unable to sync its local time via ntpdate, then it may not find its gateway route and thus not pass any client traffic. The node will still be accessible to SSH from other nodes on the mesh, so you can login manually to set a default route and update local time, but the OLSR assignment of default route appears to fail until local time is updated.

A further complication is that a repeater node with badly out-of-sync local time seems to also cause neighboring repeater nodes to also not find their default route, i.e. spreading the problem to more than one node. This problem, as I've observed it, is extremely sporadic. E.g. rebooting all nodes in the mesh can fix it.

The best measure I've found to avoid the problem is to use the OLSR SmartGateway feature, which Commotion OpenWRT does, along with a recurring ntpdate job that periodically sync the node's local time. That is, if ntpdate doesn't succeed on boot-up due to no Internet access, it will run again (and again) after a few minutes, until the gateway node is available.

(The Commotion images I published in a comment to issue #308 do this.)

I had posed this question on the olsr-users listserv a while back, although no one was quite sure what caused the problem. OLSRd itself shouldn't have a hard dependency on whether the node's local time is in sync.

Finally, do please note this problem is not unique to Commotion. I've experienced it on mesh nodes running ROBIN for atheros (OLSRd v0.5.6-r8) and plain vanilla OpenWRT Backfire v10.03.1 for ar71xx (OLSRd v0.6.1-3).

785,Commotion-admin, [olsrd] Apparent OLSR sensitivity to node,"Thu, 17 Oct 2013 08:29:35 -0700",-0700,Ben West,"An ugly hack that may work is to scan files in /etc/* on boot, or wherever relevant, and extract the most recent modification date.  Then set local time to that datetime, if local time is older.  This would depend on just how large of a time offset olsrd-mod-mdp will tolerate.

Here is /etc/rc.local with said ugly hack, in use on TP-Link TL-MR3020's, which don't preserve local time across reboot.  You would likely want to add an if statement first verifying whether the local time is indeed older.

Possibly commotiond too, although I've not had opportunity to test that.

So, the zram_swap method described above lacks a bit in robustness.  I think the mlock command can be used to prevent specific processes from being swapped out, although I'm uncertain of whether OpenWRT has this tool integrated.

that there is some new fangled bug in the version script when it is in a

chance.

I think it makes more sense to have your branch on github where it is also
easier for you to look at what commits you want to pull over as time goes

Tell me the commit id you are using, and I will make a branch pointing to

We could make this happen with a combination of stylesheets and ARIA markup.  The most commonly used screen readers offer support for ARIA and *some* automatically select a speech/aural stylesheet if one is offered.  (`aural` was offered for CSS2, `speech` is the variety used in CSS3. Listing it as either media type will still work, however).

Aria example: if H1 is styled to look like a button in css, the code could read `<h1 role=button>Events</h1>`. This would appear normally to average users, but would be `<button>Events</button>` in the [accessibility tree](http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria-implementation/#def_accessibility_tree).

1002,Commotion-admin," [luci-commotion] If root password is set,","Mon, 04 Nov 2013 07:26:16 -0800",-0800,areynold,"Addresses opentechinstitute/commotion-openwrt/issues/29

Luci has Set Password commands in 6 files, only two of which (/usr/lib/lua/luci/model/cbi/admin_system/admin.lua and /usr/lib/lua/luci/controller/admin/system.lua) are found in Commotion.

admin.lua has been rewritten to show a conditional form field if a password has been set. Because admin.lua contains ssh form fields, including a section to upload an ssh key, the root password is required to make ANY changes on that page. If no password exists (as on first boot), the existing password field will not be shown or required.

system.lua contained an action_passwd field that did not seem to be used. That function has been removed.

The command line `passwd` command does not yet require an existing password.

Patches should be submitted to luci.

To test:
1. On first boot, click the &quot;set a password&quot; option in the alert box (not quickstart). You will be prompted for a password as the page loads (all admin pages request a password), but the page itself should only show fields for the new password and confirmation, not an existing password.
2. Set a root password. The change should be successful.
3. Run quickstart.
4. Click the Administration icon at the bottom of the page, then click the System &gt; Administration link. You should see a section requiring the existing root password.
5. Enter the correct password and change the root password. Confirm that the change was successful by logging in via ssh.
6. Enter the correct password and make a change to dropbear. Confirm that the change was successful by viewing /etc/config/dropbear.
7. Enter an incorrect password and make a change to dropbear. Confirm that changes were rejected by viewing /etc/config/dropbear.
8. Enter an incorrect password and change the root password. Confirm that changes were rejected by logging in via ssh.

1003,Commotion-admin, [luci-commotion] Modularize Commotion Helpers,"Mon, 04 Nov 2013 07:43:39 -0800",-0800,Seamus Tuohy,"The new modular commotion helpers packages have been created.  I am leaving testing instructions for individual package maintainers here so that I can track all testing before submitting and accepting all pull requests related to this at the same time. 
 
The following repo's (issue_30 branch) need to be tested:

commotion-dashboard-helper - Nat/Andrew?
luci-commotion-quickstart - Seamus
luci-theme-commotion - Seamus/Dan/Andrew?
luci-commotion-apps - Dan
luci-commotion-splash - Dan
luci-commotion - Seamus/Dan/Andrew?

TO TEST:
Download the commotion-openwrt repo and change the commotion-feed repo in feeds.conf to the following

src-git commotion git://github.com/opentechinstitute/commotion-feed.git;issue_30_test

All repo's will be compiled on their current issue_30 test branch. From there you can look at the diff of your individual test branch and devise a test to cause the code to execute.

This can be an oppourtunity to create scripted unit-tests for your luci-applications. For instructions on how to build a command line script to easily recreate a luci submission please look at https://github.com/elationfoundation/luci_tutorials/blob/master/06-debugging.md#recreate-and-get-lua-error-debugging-output-on-the-command-line-

You can then ensure that the proper line of code was called by following the instructions at https://github.com/elationfoundation/luci_tutorials/blob/master/06-debugging.md#line-by-line-call-trace to get a full line trace of your code. This will allow you to ensure that you have tested each componenet and that it will be easy for you to reporduce this condition in your code if you need to in the future.

Once you have tested your pull request, please comment on this issue with the repo tested. Once every repo has been tested I will do accept all the pull requests at one time, and if you have created scripted tests (please do) I will then run all scripted tests to ensure that all pull requests together do not create any unintentional bugs.

Then we will celebrate. It will be a glorious festival of music and cheering. There will be drums, and singers, and stories of our epic accomplishments... or we will just add a release note and be on our way.

1016,Commotion-admin, [nm-dispatcher-olsrd] Decompose (#3),"Mon, 04 Nov 2013 13:14:50 -0800",-0800,technosopher,"This pull request overhauls nm-dispatcher-olsrd to leverage the new commotionc-based core &quot;library&quot;, which now contains all essential functions needed to establish a commotion network.  This pull request therefore depends on https://github.com/opentechinstitute/commotion-linux-py/commit/f37ed6651e213d062a77932508cd65b1f29c1003).  For convenience and completeness, this pull request should be tested in tandem with https://github.com/opentechinstitute/commotion-mesh-applet/commit/85aaf2ea874c9f4e2bb0e66f37cc61217a781b7e (although nm-dispatcher-olsrd can theoretically function independently of the mesh-applet)

Closes issue #1 .  

To test this pull request, all of the following steps must be done for our two supported platforms (Ubuntu 12.04 or later, and Debian testing):
- Install the commotion-linux-py, olsrd, python-networkmanager, and commotion-wpasupplicant debian packages from downloads.commotionwireless.net/linux with dpkg -i
- On debian, recompile and reinstall the wpasupplicant package with CONFIG_IBSS_RSN=y set in &lt;extracted source package&gt;/debian/config/linux.  (To do this, apt-get source wpasupplicant, make the change, then dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -uc -b in the root of the extracted source package, and the dpkg -i the newly-rebuilt package)
- Confirm that sample config files have been installed in /etc/commotion/profiles.d
- Modify or create a new profile in this directory.  Reconnect to any network, so that the dispatcher runs.  Confirm that the corresponding NetworkManager profile now exists in /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections
- Connect to a mesh network using Network Manager.  Confirm that olsrd is automatically started.
- Optimally, confirm that the client can connect to an encrypted mesh, see neighbors (iw dev &lt;wireless interface) station dump), get routes, and actually connect over ssh/http(s).

KNOWN BUGS:
Even though olsrd is running properly, it may sometimes fail to get routes when operating in the context of an encrypted mesh.  This bug may be in upstream; in any case, it is beyond the scope of this pull request.

To test this pull request, all of the following steps must be done for our three supported platforms (Ubuntu 12.04 or later, Ubuntu 11.10 or earlier, and Debian testing):

-  Install the commotion-linux-py, olsrd, python-networkmanager, and commotion-wpasupplicant debian packages from downloads.commotionwireless.net/linux with dpkg -i
-  On debian, recompile and reinstall the wpasupplicant package with CONFIG_IBSS_RSN=y set in /debian/config/linux.

- Log in and log out of a user session to confirm that the applet loads automatically.
- Test all menu entries.  Confirm that a signal-strength icon shows up next to any profile that is compatible with an active mesh.  Edit a network profile using the built-in vi-based editor.  Connect to a mesh using the applet menu, and confirm that all mesh status menu options are (a) available, and (b) produce useful information.  
- Check /var/log/syslog to confirm that there are log messages coming in from commotion-mesh-applet.  


KNOWN BUGS:
- Even though olsrd is running properly, it may sometimes fail to get routes when operating in the context of an encrypted mesh. This bug may be in upstream; in any case, it is beyond the scope of this pull request.  If you run into problems testing the applet with an encrypted mesh, try using an unencrypted one.  
- The check for IBSS_RSN compatibility doesn&#39;t work for debian testing (hence the need to preemptively recompile wpasupplicant on debian).  There is a partial fix in commotion-linux-py&#39;s postinst script; watch closely to see if the check fails when installing on debian (which it should)

the make a clean build. 

Once the build is complete, confirm that this fix works by 
a) ensuring that the node is able to mesh with existing nodes on an encrypted backhaul and
b) connecting to the node&#39;s AP using encryption.

Once those tests are complete, merge this branch at the same time that you merge no-27-custom-wpad-mini branch in the commotion-feed repo.

**Setup:**
1. Flash 2 nodes with the pull request dependencies, and at least one node with the regular nightly build.
2. record the memory usage of commotion-service-manager (CSM) upon boot.
3. Set the default app lifetime on the nodes to 1 hour (in the apps portal settings page).
4. Add 5-10 unique applications on each node (including the node(s) without CSM), meanwhile monitoring for any crashes of CSM or unusually high memory usage.

**Expected results:**
1. CSM should not crash
2. CSM should not use abnormally large amounts of memory or lead to node crashes.
3. Apps added to a node with CSM should appear almost instantly on the other node with CSM.
4. Apps on nodes with CSM should **not** show up on nodes without CSM, and vice versa.
5. Apps should properly expire after one hour, both on the node they were added on, as well as nodes that picked up their announcements.
6. Expired apps should no longer appear in `/etc/config/applications`, and their Avahi service file should have been removed from `/etc/avahi/services`.
7. Running `kill -s USR1 $(pgrep commotion-service-manager)` should result in a `;`-delimited dump of service announcements in the file `/tmp/local-services.out`.

If you run into problems right from the beginning, be sure that `servald` is running on each node and that `servald id self` returns a valid SID. If not, restart `servald`.

1328,Commotion-admin, [luci-commotion] Require existing password (#108),"Wed, 20 Nov 2013 11:53:56 -0800",-0800,areynold,"Addresses opentechinstitute/commotion-openwrt#29

Luci has Set Password commands in 6 files, only two of which (/usr/lib/lua/luci/model/cbi/admin_system/admin.lua and /usr/lib/lua/luci/controller/admin/system.lua) are found in Commotion.

admin.lua has been rewritten to show a conditional form field if a password has been set. Because admin.lua contains ssh form fields, including a section to upload an ssh key, the root password is required to make ANY changes on that page. If no password exists (as on first boot), the existing password field will not be shown or required.

system.lua contained an action_passwd field that did not seem to be used. That function has been removed.

The command line passwd command does not yet require an existing password.

Patches should be submitted to luci.

To test:
1. On first boot, click the &quot;set a password&quot; option in the alert box (not quickstart). You will be prompted for a password as the page loads (all admin pages request a password), but the page itself should only show fields for the new password and confirmation, not an existing password.
2. Set a root password. The change should be successful.
3. Run quickstart.
4. Click the Administration icon at the bottom of the page, then click the System &gt; Administration link. You should see a section requiring the existing root password.
5. Enter the correct password and change the root password. Confirm that the change was successful by logging in via ssh.
6. Enter the correct password and make a change to dropbear. Confirm that the change was successful by viewing /etc/config/dropbear.
7. Enter an incorrect password and make a change to dropbear. Confirm that changes were rejected by viewing /etc/config/dropbear.
8. Enter an incorrect password and change the root password. Confirm that changes were rejected by logging in via ssh.

Users should be able to override profile dns entries.
To test:
1. Select Commotion &gt; Mesh Configuration (manual) from the top menu
2. Add two ip addresses in the DNS Servers field and save &amp; apply. When the page reloads, the field should contain both ip addresses, and changes should appear in /etc/config/network on all interfaces using proto commotion.
3. Delete the ip addresses from the DNS Servers field in meshconfig. The dns entry should be removed from all interfaces in /etc/config/network with proto commotion.

The two can be tested in tandem

To test:

1) After flashing a node, and while connected via ethernet, go to the url &quot;thisnode&quot; in your browser (as you would normally). 
You should see the admin page.

2) On your machine:
$ host thisnode
You should see: 
thisnode.mesh.local has address 169.254.xx.xx

3) Back in your browser, run quickstart and ssh into the node (again, via ethernet)
$ uci show network

You should see an entry for the thisnode alias that looks like this:
network.thisnode=alias
network.thisnode.interface=plug
network.thisnode.ipaddr=169.254.7.130
network.thisnode.netmask=255.255.0.0
network.thisnode.proto=static

4) $ less /etc/config/network
You should NOT see an entry for the thisnode alias

5) Reboot the node. Recheck steps 1 through 4.

Store in a cool, dry place.

Suggestion to make Commotion QS a separable package so that it can be installed or removed after flashing, or built without it completely such that other functionality isn't broken.

The 'sizeof' call is not the right way to get this value. It will only return the size of the pointer, not the size of what the pointer points to. Additionally, even if it did, sizeof is a precompiler macro, as such it can only work on types and other statically assigned values. Since 'address' is dynamically assigned, you need to use a function like 'strlen' or 'strnlen' to find the length of it.

It looks as if, while it is possible, it will be hard enough to warrent being a version 1.1 feature. In fact, since each wireless interface page allows the addition of an arbitrary number of interfaces (post quickstart) it may not be needed at all. We will have to look at user testing to determine this. Gateway configurations will still be implemented though.

TLDR: Should we rename this section to gateway controls? If so I need a new section name

These are actually potentially valid for all three types of interfaces, in that I realized that all the different default functionality for interfaces can be encapsulated by these three options. Also, I realized that a manual switch for 'gateway' is global, and not specific to a given interface. Given the potential for abuse, we should probably hold off of allowing a manual gateway switch until we have #52.

option meshed (true/false) : controls whether this interface passes OLSR traffic. Default off for ap & plug, on for mesh.

option announced (true/false) : controls whether the subnet on this interface is advertised as an HNA. Default true for ap, and for plug acting as a dhcp server, but default false for mesh and for plug acting as a DHCP client.

option dhcp (client, server, none, auto) : client always attempts to get a DHCP lease. Server always attempts to hand one out. None does not attempt to do anything with DHCP; it just attempts to configure the interface. Auto is the current default functionality. Default auto for plug, server for ap, and none for mesh.

* Hostname will require us to add an olsrd plugin
* As far as I can tell, RX signal will require some additional tooling to collect and correlate with olsr info. As critzo notes above, this can be moved to 1.1.
* The neighbors list currently uses txtinfo, not jsoninfo.
* Number of hops is available through both txtinfo and jsoninfo. We should decide on a plugin before implementing.
* Gateway is available through txtinfo and jsoninfo. We should decide on a plugin  before implementing.
* This implementation is almost a direct copy of the existing olsr neighbors page, which is almost suitable for use as a module. A better long term implementation would be to rewrite olsr's neighbors page to accept different arguments.

Default key is being removed entirely, and as one doesn't exist, serval will create a new keyring+key.

There are separate issues in that we should be supporting a full serval keyring suite, *and possibly* also setting they serval keyring to be off by default.  There are heavy ui, security, and crypto implications with both.

1632,Commotion-admin, [luci-commotion-apps] fixed some bugs with app,"Mon, 09 Dec 2013 11:25:43 -0800",-0800,Dan Staples,"this fixes a few things:

1. the default app icons were SVGs, which don&#39;t render in some older browsers (notably &lt;= IE 8). This changes them to PNGs.
2. the icons in the picker would be highlighted black when hovered over, which would make them totally black due to icon transparency. This changes the highlight color to a light pink in line with our color scheme.
3. &#39;http://&#39; and the &#39;thisnode&#39; alias were prepended to each app icon path unnecessarily. This removes that, and has the benefit of not breaking if we decided to change the name of our alias in the future.
4. Removed lots of extraneous files in the /luci-static directory.

To test:
1. on the create app page, and mouse hover over the default icons
2. choose one of the icons, and submit the app. make sure it shows up correctly on the listing.
3. Edit the app, and change the icon to be an external image on the internet. Make sure it shows up correctly on the listing page (might need to get splashed so it allows external requests).

1) we could redirect the user back to the same page on admin password change to give them a success message. (this would mean that if they modify the admin password and an interface password we would have to indicate that they should click ""save"" again to set the interface password.
2) We indicate to them that the admin password will be set automatically and not show up on the confirmation page.
3) Add a special section to the confirmation page that will flag values that were automatically added to say. ""Your admin password was automatically set, would you like to save these other values?""
4) Make that same section a faked ""value to save"". This means that if a user reverts, that admin password will not revert and may cause a non-intuitive experience.

You will lose access while it restarts.

TO TEST:

1a) Before running quickstart, type &#39;thisnode&#39; into your browser. You should get the admin page.
Do not run quickstart yet.

1b) Telnet into the node. 
$ logread | grep commotion.hotplug.thisnode

You should see:
&quot;Adding thisnode to /etc/hosts&quot;
&quot;Checking for UCI entry for thisnode alias&quot;
&quot;No entry found. Creating UCI entry for &#39;thisnode&#39; alias&quot;
&quot;Setting &#39;thisnode&#39; ip address to 169.254.xx.xx&quot;

1c) Go back to your browser. Run quickstart.

1d) Log into the node again.
$ logread | grep commotion.hotplug.thisnode

You should see:
&quot;Found thisnode in /etc/hosts&quot;
&quot;Checking for UCI entry for thisnode alias&quot;
&quot;thisnode alias exists with ip address 169.254.xx.xx&quot;

Since we&#39;re here, let&#39;s just do a sanity check:

$ less /etc/hosts

You should see an entry for &#39;thisnode&#39;

$ less /etc/config/network

You should see a config section for &#39;alias&#39;
The type is plug, ip addr is 169.254.xx.xx, proto is static, netmask is 255.255.0.0

1.  Install on a test machine with two wireless adapters, one which supports both ad-hoc mode and ibss-rsn (via nl80211 support), and one which does not.  Ensure that both adapters are active.  Attempt to connect to a Commotion mesh using the applet, preferably several times.

Although I still am not at all sure what's going on behind the scenes, I suspect that the problem lies either (a) with the rampant, silent channel hoping and merging that seems to happen when a Linux client is in the presence of multiple networks with the same BSSIDs and ESSIDs, or (b) some bizzare interaction between olsrd and IBSS_RSN.  The first option is the more likely, I think, which means that we should probably implement the feature that will dynamically generate BSSIDs a hash of SSID and channel before digging into this issue much further.

1a) Before running quickstart, type 'thisnode' into your browser. You should get the admin page.

thisnode alias typed into the browser before quickstart does not display the admin page. The luci interface begins to load (black page with white text at the top) but then shows page not found error.

1b) Telnet into the node.

Those functions are included in https://github.com/opentechinstitute/commotiond/blob/master/openwrt/lib/functions/commotion.sh (installed as /lib/functions/commotion.sh on a node). Currently the functions are written assuming that they're using the old-format output from the daemon, as opposed to the new key-value JSON format. These functions need to be updated against the new output format and new commands.

Output is of an arbitrary key-value format:
```
{ ""key"": ""value"", ""key"": ""value"" }
```
with unique keys. Exact output per command is still being determined. Also, unlike before, the commotion client returns true or false correctly depending on whether the command succeeds. So for some commands, it may be as easy as running the command and interpreting $? in order to echo ""Command succeeded!"" or ""Command failed!"". Output can be parsed through grep, sed and the like, but ideal would be proper JSON parsing. OpenWRT has a shell script JSON parser in a shell library called jsn.sh or something similar, which they use for parsing JSON output.

The shell functions should retain their current output format to the extent possible so as to keep from having to update things in other Commotion scripts that utilize the functions. We shouldn't need to add any additional commands unless needed, even though commotiond now supports additional ones. Below is a list of all commotiond commands:

up <iface> <profile> -same as before
down <iface> -same as before
status <iface> -same as before
state <iface> <property> -same as before
profiles -replaces list_profiles
set <profile> <property> <value> -allows you to set profile values
get <profile> <property> <value> -allows you to get profile values
save <profile> <file> -allows you to save a profile to a new file in the
profiles.d directory
new <profile> -allows you to create a new profile
delete <profile> -allows you to delete a profile
ipgen <ip address> <netmask> -allows you to generate an arbitrary IP
address from the nodeid
nodeid <id> -run without arguments, prints the nodeid. Can also set the
nodeid.

FROM:

https://github.com/opentechinstitute/commotiond/issues/52 (out of band conversation)

""After reflecting on the old notes in this issue, your proposed options in the other issue, which options are mutually exclusive, and our previous conversation, here are my new proposed options. These are actually potentially valid for all three types of interfaces, in that I realized that all the different default functionality for interfaces can be encapsulated by these three options. Also, I realized that a manual switch for 'gateway' is global, and not specific to a given interface. Given the potential for abuse, we should probably hold off of allowing a manual gateway switch until we have #52.

option meshed (true/false) : controls whether this interface passes OLSR traffic. Default off for ap & plug, on for mesh.

option announced (true/false) : controls whether the subnet on this interface is advertised as an HNA. Default true for ap, and for plug acting as a dhcp server, but default false for mesh and for plug acting as a DHCP client.

option dhcp (client, server, none, auto) : client always attempts to get a DHCP lease. Server always attempts to hand one out. None does not attempt to do anything with DHCP; it just attempts to configure the interface. Auto is the current default functionality. Default auto for plug, server for ap, and none for mesh.""

Shouldn't my olsrd.conf plugin parameter now be the location of the commotion socket (if the default is not okay) instead of specifying the serval keyring path? I thought that commotiond contained the necessary bits to hide all the serval specific ""stuff"" from the end user? 

Oh, but now I see below where we need to grab the key from the serval keyring to get things started. 

In either case, it seems like it might be nice to have an option to allow the user to customize the path to the commotion socket.

yes, adding a config option for the commotion socket would be a great idea. but we still need to get the serval path and SID from config parameters. The nice thing is those values are defined in interface-specific commotion profiles, and then fetched from the commotion daemon with a hotplug script and put into the olsrd-mdp config.

@jheretic, any thoughts on including the commotion debug macros in commotion.h?

-- Commit Summary --

  * fixed merge conflicts
  * removed unneeded old commotion helpers
  * adding basic quickstart menu dispatcher based flow models
  * finished basic development and testing on flow model. This commit proves functionality, it does NOT show a working implementation of the flow model for the basic menu. But, this does put a pause to issue 77 until all pages are completed.
  * created controllers for new menu structure and touched the files required for the new structure.
  * added status page template and controller hooks for all tabs.
  * Added rough cbi pages for client controls. Added nodogsplash uci file and corresponding init.d file that still needs to be added to uci-track to controll nodogsplash settings.
  * Added rought cbi for a passwords page that provides options to add a passwoed for all the interfaces
  * added about, help, license sections for Chris
  * added help page template.
  * added about page template and updated help page template
  * added license page, added h1 tags to help and about pages
  * added most of the wireless network cbi content except some prettyness and a key deletion upon encryption flag deletion. Also, need to go back and redo much of the basic_mn page after learning some things.
  * Fixed broken template path in commotion.lua
  * completed mesh and access point interface creators. Bug 119 to be addressed before closing issues.
  * Merge branch &#39;usability&#39; of https://github.com/opentechinstitute/luci-commotion into usability
  * removed unneeded placeholder. Section is anonymous.
  * Preliminary port of neighbors page
  * added controls to only have addremove on these interfaces when not in quickstart, and defaults for quickstart process
  * Commented out table.sort line that breaks nearby_md
  * Update nearby_md fields to reflect UI review requests
  * about to remove the functionality to add other wireless interfaces because it will not allow me to finish this for R1
  * deleted wireless additions per last commit
  * added gateway configuration
  * issue 121 fixed controllers
  * Leaving gateway, neighbors, rx signal for v1.1
  * Removing links to neighbors from html page, since firewall rules prevent AP clients from reaching backhaul IP addresses
  * remove unused lq eplanations
  * sketched node info table
  * Added ETX definition
  * Removed debug code
  * Removed unused functions
  * Node info section is being handled by status.htm
  * Merge pull request #122 from opentechinstitute/tab-nearby-md
  * added quickstart confirmation page and the start of regular menu confirmation pages
  * Merge pull request #118 from opentechinstitute/usability-templates
  * Merge branch &#39;usability&#39; of https://github.com/opentechinstitute/luci-commotion into usability
  * some minor modifications of footer pages
  * added main status page and working (need to be tested with multiple nodes meshing. But, their error conditions work great.) status tab sub-pages. Status controller now usses a small creator function with on page includes to determine the page that is included. I would much rather battle with lua then deal with the unyeilding trauma that would come from me trying to sort out iframes. Also, ate a bag of sea salt and vinegar kettle chips. They were the worst. Thought you might want to know.
  * Added required uci hooks for nodogsplash basic ucitrack integration
  * removed init script that used suffix in favor of non-suffixed version... it was a silly idea to use a suffix really
  * moved the initial creation of uci objects into a uci-defaults script where it rightfully should go. Why run the logic everytime when we can do it only once.
  * removed save-as and reset buttons from all non-quickstart page to make room for new lua-helpers confirmation page function. Also added proper subheader flags to menu items that are major topics according to UX document.
  * updated quickstart delegator days ago and have no idea what I have changed. But, this delegator works for all four quickstart pages and concludes with the confirmation page as required
  * updated maps to use confirmation page when save is used
  * modified enc flag variable write and remove functions to set the section &#39;changed&#39; value to true so that the config confirmation hooks go off and capture a user. Also, identified that all config values that commotiond uses need to include the proper commotion functions for changing them. Possibly a check that allows me to simple have each map query commotiond on parse and see if it is changing a commotiond value, and change it in the commotion profile as well.
  * added serval mesh keychain options and enabled my serval init.d script in uci-defaults. NOTE the servald commands in the init.d script are temporary and will be replaced with working commotiond calls.
  * added a write check for correct file formatting of uploaded serval files... don&#39;t know if it works yet. Still need some more info on serval calls before work can continue.
  * fixed some spacing issues
  * updated security config to work with mesh keyring
  * removed unneeded todo comment
  * moved all application funcationality into application repo
  * starting the final clean up of the setup wizard
  * actually moved all functionality of applications to the app repo
  * added some external functionality clean up to functions created before condesing down.
  * removed old controller functions
  * removed serval keyring from menu as it is not called through the basic menu.
  * purged all mentions of quickstart from this process and replaced them with setup wizard
  * removed depricated meshprofile html page from repo
  * corrected spelling of SETUP wizard
  * updated status config to remove a failed call which caused the http content type to be replaced with plain text... which is a fun and hard to track down bug.
  * added exit codes to uci-track scripts to allow openwrt to delete them on success and corrected a minor error assigning adhoc to the ap
  * updated the menu ordering of various nodes as well as adding in some missing requirements and a note to add in a setup_wizard-end setting that will toggle the setup wizard function off after completion
  * added the begginings of a welcome page. Still need graphics and some logic behind it.
  * added welcome page to quickstart process.
  * added non admin confirmation menu to setup_wizard process
  * fixed broken link
  * changed header to represent the setup wizard process
  * removed unneeded, and error filled line about enabling a init script from uci-defaults scripts
  * fixed bugs relating to apllying on quickstart which meant that I had to copy the application functions into a script that did not require root
  * created side menu capabilities in setup wizard, as well as early finish capabilities.
  * Added in node-id identifier to the end of the hostname. NOTE that this will have to be removed when we implement any of the threat model as it creates an identifier that is unique to the device. Though, it will be a great way to track down stolen and re-flashed nodes.
  * created a more descriptive name for ucitrack-updates
  * Added a setup_wizard config. Will have to add a setting to save on saved settings sysupgrade later.
  * Actually added the config setting to turn it on by default..
  * added basic functionality for status header. Still need failsafe values and prettifying
  * added failsafes to interface values
  * Added simple gateway checker... Not proud of it, but it is there.
  * added links to take users from the confirmation and revoktion pages to the start of setup wizard and from the application page to the advanced menu.
  * setup_wizard core functions are now added upon starting instead of at boot to allow for easier saved settings sysupgrade
  * added working sidebar menu&#39;s to the setup wizard menu.
  * Apply now turns off quickstart if it is on.
  * now it also ends the check for setup wizard so that it does not hang forever
  * removed unneeded comment
  * hopfully that will allow the depends statement work
  * added controllers that will allow for admin password changes to be tracked.
  * added new reset button language
  * fixed setup wizard uci errors
  * added correct main admin menu
  * fixed status builder to correctly grab client info and not break on none
  * Changed some broken cbi values
  * moved the ordering of turning off setup wizard so it does not break the page xhr
  * added proper hostname support
  * fixed some spacing and some spelling no  logic modified
  * removed broken dependencies
  * added a correct admin password check. Still need to do changed password comparisons.
  * updated text to mention that the user will be asked to confirm creation before being allowed configuration
  * modified where the confirm controller is located and did some clean up on passwords and datatypes
  * removed bandwidth controlls per issue 73
  * updated page text
  * added default values for adhoc and ap networks, including network and profile creation for mesh networks.
  * Added correct text to interfaces.
  * updated page to reflect new conditions from JK
  * finalized status menu. All pages working fully. most work done on connected clients page and functions which I wrote without any clients. Suprised it was as close to working as it was.
  * fixed a silly error where you could not pass this page in quickstart because it would stop even if all values were empty.
  * got buttons working across all basic menus and setup wizard. They could use for some proper floating. But, they look good. Also got the apply confirm and revert pages working better. Still need to customize the confirmation page html to collect similarly sectioned items and display them for users.
  * migrating over to ubus based version of ifaces list
  * added extra option for when the radio is unknown.
  * don&#39;t check which user, since we don&#39;t have multiple users anyway currently.
  * Removing serval section as it will not be ready for R1
  * added better error handling for uploads
  * added check to include pretty button on setup wizard even though it is not a basic menu

* test that two nodes can mesh using signed routes
* latest Setup Wizard code generates the proper config information and generates good keys. The only problem is that the mdp-init command expects a file path and not a directory path. This means that we might have to change the value of the servalpath generated by SW. Just something to keep an eye out for.
* may go against the spirit of mdp-sign. I now realize that @dismantl did mean for the function to return the entire contents of the message + its signature. Unfortunately the olsrd MDP plugin was not expecting that -- it expected only the signature in the response. I'm sorry for misunderstanding and will not be offended if you reject my change and prefer to make the appropriate revisions to the caller (olsrd mdp).

opentechinstitute/commotiond#52 (out of band conversation)

""After reflecting on the old notes in this issue, your proposed options in the other issue, which options are mutually exclusive, and our previous conversation, here are my new proposed options. These are actually potentially valid for all three types of interfaces, in that I realized that all the different default functionality for interfaces can be encapsulated by these three options. Also, I realized that a manual switch for 'gateway' is global, and not specific to a given interface. Given the potential for abuse, we should probably hold off of allowing a manual gateway switch until we have #52.

option meshed (true/false) : controls whether this interface passes OLSR traffic. Default off for ap & plug, on for mesh.

option announced (true/false) : controls whether the subnet on this interface is advertised as an HNA. Default true for ap, and for plug acting as a dhcp server, but default false for mesh and for plug acting as a DHCP client.

option dhcp (client, server, none, auto) : client always attempts to get a DHCP lease. Server always attempts to hand one out. None does not attempt to do anything with DHCP; it just attempts to configure the interface. Auto is the current default functionality. Default auto for plug, server for ap, and none for mesh.""

One is that the code in the daemon generates an insufficiently unique BSSID, especially when it's the same SSID but different channels. That has now been fixed (pushing that code shortly). The second issue is that the logic in the /lib/wifi/mac80211.sh patch is not sufficiently rigorous when it comes to SSID and channel changes. That's relatively easy, but I won't be able to fix it until I can connect to a node, which I won't be able to do this evening.

1999,Commotion-admin, [luci-commotion] r1: number of mesh & ap,"Thu, 26 Dec 2013 06:22:47 -0800",-0800,areynold,"Looking through controller/commotion/status_config.lua, this may be a language mismatch, not a bug.

In this example page:
```
Providing Gateway: No

commotionMesh (On) (Secured) (0 Connections)
...
OLSR connections
?    100.74.7.140    1.000
```

The iface connection info at the top of the Status page seems to refer to DHCP leases, meaning the display of 0 connections is correct even though mesh connections are listed in the OLSR section.  If we were to change the wording in the top part to something like ""x Client Connections"" and/or change ""OLSR Connections"" to ""OLSR links"", I think it would be more clear what each section is doing. The same could be accomplished with a 1-sentence description for each section.

to test:
0) flash two nodes
1) set `applications.settings.lifetime` to `60` in `/etc/config/applications` on both nodes
2) add application to node A. Node B should assimilate the advertisement. After 60 seconds have passed, make sure the advertisement is still on node B.
3) on node A, set `applications.settings.allowpermanent` to `0` in `/etc/config/applications`.
4) add app to node B. Node A should assimilate the advertisement. In the app&#39;s section in `/etc/config/applications` on node A, `lifetime` should be `0`, and there should be an `expiration` field set to 60 seconds after the node was added. After 60 seconds, the app should disappear from node A.
5) Now set `applications.settings.lifetime` to `120` and `applications.settings.allowpermanent` to `0` on node B. Add a new app to node B; it should still expire on node A after 60 seconds.
6) Set `applications.settings.lifetime` to `240` on node A. Add an app to node B. It should expire on A after 120 seconds.

Generated PO files still have a number of duplicate strings. Reviewing them, I did a QA check on all the generated strings, found a few that needed to be updated & pushed those to master branches of luci-commotion, luci-commotion-apps per @jheretic

The perl script should do a final check for duplicate strings removing duplicates and msgstr line after it.

To test:
1. Copy a block of text with multiple indent levels (e.g., a few stanzas of /etc/config/network)
2. open a scratch file (e.g., `vi foo`) and paste. The text should appear properly formatted.
3. In the same file, in command mode (`&lt;esc&gt;`), type `:set ai`, then switch to insert and paste again. Each line of text should be indented one additional level.

Therefore, it's currently necessary to provide access to it for the client interfaces. We should evaluate the downsides of either:

* removing access to it from the client network, or
* separating control-plane traffic into a separate IP subnet

This is only of concern for meshes with attached host/client networks, as any full node will implicitly have access to the control-plane anyway. But it's still a way to potentially limit some of our attack surface.

2244,Commotion-admin, [luci-commotion] Mesh Over eth0 broken (#150),"Thu, 16 Jan 2014 13:39:14 -0800",-0800,Seamus Tuohy,"Meshing over eth0 does not work currently. 

The interface needs to expose two fields when the mesh over wired option is clicked to let the user specify a ip address and a netmask. If these are defined then the device can mesh over the ethernet interface as desired. This seems like a easy enough fix to this problem that does not raise the bar too high for new users since it is on the alternate path in the setup wizard.

Setting the dhcp of the wired interface to ""auto"" dhcp with ""meshing"" enabled also seems to kill the olsrd process so we will either have to fix the hotplug scripts that cause this or to force static ip adderess/netmask on nodes wired interfaces that are meshing and have it turn off the automatic option.

Email Address: andygunn at opentechinstitute.org
What type of bug it is? Minor (minor loss of function)
What were you doing on the device right before and when the error occurred?
This bug involved a test connection between two Commotion nodes - a NanoStation M2 and a PicoStation M2, in close proximity (~25 feet apart). Two fresh TFTP factory installs were performed on the equipment, with Commotion version 1.0, downloaded Tuesday January 14th.

Viewing the ""Status"" page under the Basic Menu in the Administrator panel. At the top of the page there shows:
commotionAP (On) (Unsecured) (1 Client Connections)
commotionMesh (On) (Secured) (0 Client Connections)

(Ignore the fact that there is no mesh connection - this is another bug filed in another report, that mesh connections do not always connect on boot)
Please describe what behavior you expected:
I expected to see the name of the Access Point and Mesh connection that were named in the Setup stage of configuring the device.
Please describe what behavior you experienced that you believe is wrong:
There should be the actual name of the interfaces that were set during setup, something along the lines of:

Access Point: CassCo.Co-AMP-AP (Unsecured) -- 1 client connected
Mesh Link: Commotion (Secured) -- 0 Neighbor Connections

Also, the format of having information in parentheses is a bit unclear. If the interface is enabled, does it make sense to show it as (on)? Maybe just remove the line if the interface is disabled, since it isn't going to have any connections if it is off.

2250,Commotion-admin, [commotion-router] Mesh interfaces occationally,"Fri, 17 Jan 2014 12:07:02 -0800",-0800,Seamus Tuohy,"This intermittent bug does not cause any processes to fail but will stop the node from sending any mesh packets over the network. I believe that this is associated with many other bugs we have been seeing. This is most easily recreated by re-naming the mesh ssid in the basic user interface but does not seem to be associated with the name given or length. Though, with that said, and the rule of large numbers being what it is I have seen the first instance using a string that is greater than nine characters with a number as the last character and a dash in the middle. It is not required, nor does it always work... but, it works more consistently than others.

cc: @jheretic as this is most likely a issue with hotplug/netifd and the kernel as shown in logs further down.

This is most easily identified as broken by looking at httpinfo and checking the Destination Gateway. It will have all 0's on the netmask.

$ netcat localhost 2006
> hit return again to have it return the data

Here are some examples from various logs I have taken.

Best I can tell the kernel seems to be failing and not triggering a new scan to find a IBSS to join on instances where this occurs. See the ""kern.info"" messages in the ""good"" logfiles below. The bad logfiles are just the same area in the logfile. The first ""BAD"" logfile shows the last time that there are kernel messages in the bad logfiles. I assume this is where the kernel error actually exists. The final ""GOOD"" log section shows what I assume to be the set of commands that the kernel is missing in bas restarts.

2251,Commotion-admin, [commotion-router] dnsmasq networking error,"Fri, 17 Jan 2014 13:03:18 -0800",-0800,Seamus Tuohy,"Due to the header file displaying the ipv4 address of a mesh network interface when dnsmasq breaks the luci interfaces break as well. While I will add an issue for the interfaces the dnsmasq issue is far more important and sinister.


Once this bug appears it seems to continue to present itself across multiple runs of ""/etc/init.d/network restart"".
Running ""/etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart"" or "".../dnsmasq reload"" does nothing either. 

This problem persisted through multiple reboots.

I believe that this bug is related to this logfile section.

I'm going to attempt to track down this bug once and for all, and either fix it or find out its exact triggers so that we can work around it effectively (I suspect that deleting and recreating the adhoc interface on any channel change may be an effective countermeasure).

Fix for issues 141 on luci-commotion.

https://github.com/opentechinstitute/luci-commotion/issues/141

To test:
1) Take an R1 node and restart networking and configuring all sorts of things until luci-commotion issue 95 appears. https://github.com/opentechinstitute/commotion-router/issues/95 This will break all the interfaces. 
2) scp over this modified header to replace the existing header file
3) remove the luci-cach&#39;s on the node.
4) refresh page 

If the page loads then this fix works.

You might want to test just one first by setting it up with a compatible static ip on your device with multicast/olsrd and simply wiresharking for the broadcast traffic. But I have never played with that over ethernet so I don&#39;t have instructions.

For now, it is recommended that the Linux client be used only in environments in which only one Commotion mesh network is active.

Although the client's network-manager indicates a successful connection to the ad-hoc network, pinging or communicating with any or some of the ad-hoc peers fails (which then leads to olsrd not getting any packets from which to establish routes).

2326,Commotion-admin, [commotion-linux-py] olsrd fails to get,"Mon, 27 Jan 2014 12:07:21 -0800",-0800,Dan Staples,"I'm really certain this has nothing to do with interfering ad-hoc networks. We were able to reproduce the problem both when there were other ad-hoc networks present, and when there weren't any others. I did extensive testing to show that the olsrd route problem occurred if and only if the client had bad links with all its ad-hoc neighbors. As soon as one good ad-hoc link was established, olsrd started receiving olsrd packets and building a routing table. This indicates that the problem was at the link layer, not application layer.

My working hypothesis is that since the problem occurs inconsistently in the presence of other constant factors, it is indicative of a race condition. I believe the network-manager scripts are running asynchronously, and that this is responsible for screwing up the network stack during the connection process, possibly related to wpa_supplicant.

To test this hypothesis, we'd need to do try joining the same ad-hoc network both through network-manager, and without network-manager. If the later doesn't show the same symptoms, then we'll know the source of the problem.

Homepage: https://github.opentechinstitute.org/commotion-linux-py
Description: Implements core Commotion (mesh networking with olsrd, serval, etc.) functionality as a python module
 Provides fundamental Commotion routines for use by a variety of front-end utilities.  Also provides a custom-compiled
 version of wpa_supplicant for use on older systems whose stock wpa_supplicant binaries were compiled without support
 for encrypted mesh connections (IBSS-RSN).

I believe that this error stems from the following statement from /usr/lib/lua/luci/controller/commotion/apps_controller.lua between lines 324 and 330:

```
          if (values.uri ~= '' and not dt.ip4addr(values.uri)) then                                                           
                 url = string.gsub(values.uri, '[a-z]+://', '', 1)                                                            
                 url = url:match(""^[^/:]+"") -- remove anything after the domain name/IP address                               
                 -- url = url:match(""[%a%d-]+\.%w+$"") -- remove subdomains (** actually we should probably keep subdomains **)
          else                                                                                                             
                 url = values.uri                                                                                          
          end
```
This statement checks any non-empty string that is also not a proper ip4addr and then cleans the address. If the string is empty though, it will pass the string along to be passed to the shell later. This will lead to an error. I would suggest changing line 328-330 as follows. 
```
- else
-url=values.uri
-end
+ elseif values.uri and values.uri ~= """" then
+url=values.uri
... -> All the way to line 356 enclosing the rest of this section
+else
+error_info.uri = ""A non-empty URL exist or I will cry. Do you really want to make me cry. Why would you do that. YOU MONSTER!""
+end
```
Feel free to change the error message to suit your purposes. :) Upon making this change I received a later error message. Not the error message I put in the error_info.uri, but one which rewrote the error_info.uri later in the function. Which was sad. I thought my error message really was educational.

The URL entry also accepted ""http://"" This meant that when i clicked on the application it went to a blank page. It does not error out though, and does what someone would expect upon putting in a blank http:// value... so I don't know if that is as much a bug as a odd feature. It also seems to accept gopher addresses, which made me squeal a bit.

Currently, on errors in the advanced menu the interface still has the advanced menu hidden. This is something we should put in a later bug request to fix. It does not belong with this current feature, but should be addressed nonetheless.

The port section will take any 5 or less char numerical value less than 65536 as desired. EXCEPT it will also take 00, 000, etc. This does not seem to append a port on to the end of the link though, of course, neither does any other port I put on an application. They all save correctly, and show it in the admin interface, but the ports do not show up in the link. I don't know if that is correct or not. I should also point out that this is after the other fixes above.

to test: write test program, build a complex nested object using lists and objects and various basic types, and print it using `co_list_print()` or `co_tree_print()`!

Here&#39;s code for a sample object:

    CHECK_MEM((params = co_tree16_create()));
    CHECK(co_tree_insert(params,&quot;testint&quot;,sizeof(&quot;testint&quot;),co_int8_create(-123,0)),&quot;Failed to insert testint into request tree&quot;);

    co_obj_t *tree2 = co_tree16_create();
    co_obj_t *tree3 = co_tree16_create();
    co_tree_insert(tree3,&quot;subtree2&quot;,sizeof(&quot;subtree2&quot;),co_str8_create(&quot;subtree&quot;,sizeof(&quot;subtree&quot;),0));

    co_tree_insert(tree2,&quot;subtree&quot;,sizeof(&quot;subtree&quot;),tree3);
    co_tree_insert(tree2,&quot;foo&quot;,sizeof(&quot;foo&quot;),co_str8_create(&quot;foo&quot;,sizeof(&quot;foo&quot;),0));
    co_obj_t *list = co_list16_create();
    co_list_append(list,co_str8_create(&quot;bar&quot;,sizeof(&quot;bar&quot;),0));
    co_tree_insert(tree2,&quot;bar&quot;,sizeof(&quot;bar&quot;),list);
    co_obj_t *tree4 = co_tree16_create();
    co_tree_insert(tree4,&quot;baz&quot;,sizeof(&quot;baz&quot;),co_str8_create(&quot;baz&quot;,sizeof(&quot;baz&quot;),0));
    co_list_append(list,tree4);
    co_obj_t *list2 = co_list16_create();
    co_list_append(list2,co_str8_create(&quot;egg&quot;,sizeof(&quot;egg&quot;),0));
    co_list_append(list,list2);
    CHECK(co_tree_insert(params,&quot;test3&quot;,sizeof(&quot;test3&quot;),tree2),&quot;Failed to insert tree2 into request tree&quot;);

2483,Commotion-admin, [commotion-router] Confirm mesh connections work,"Wed, 19 Feb 2014 10:18:20 -0800",-0800,critzo,"This issue is likely fixed (likely cause was BSSID issue) but needs to be confirmed in testing. Originally submitted to the Commotion website by @andygunn in post-testing of the 1.0 release.

**What were you doing on the device right before and when the error occurred?**
This bug involved a test connection between two Commotion nodes - a NanoStation M2 and a PicoStation M2, in close proximity (~25 feet apart). Two fresh TFTP factory installs were performed on the equipment, with Commotion version 1.0, downloaded Tuesday January 14th.

The two devices were set up, side-by-side, with identical mesh connection information. They were configured with different hostnames, APs, etc, but all mesh information (SSID, channel, password) were set identically.

**Please describe what behavior you expected:**
We expected the devices to create a mesh connection between the devices.

**Please describe what behavior you experienced that you believe is wrong:**
The devices will not mesh reliably if they are set with an encrypted connection. We experimented with various changes, and were able to mesh the devices together, but without consistent results. An example:

The two routers had encrypted mesh connections enabled, but would not connect. After disabling the encryption password on the mesh connection, they would mesh. We then re-enabled the encryption password, and the routers were able to mesh. After rebooting one of the devices, it meshed.

We then performed a reset to defaults on one of the devices (after encountering a different bug), reconfiguring and rebooting, and they do not mesh.

2488,Commotion-admin, [luci-commotion] Utilize OpenWrt's 'auto-refresh',"Wed, 19 Feb 2014 10:26:19 -0800",-0800,critzo,"This issue was originally submitted to the Commotion website by @andygunn in post-testing of the 1.0 release.

OpenWRT has a feature that displays a button labeled ""Auto-Refresh On"", which is included in the luci-commotion Status page, but does not provide useful or expected information in the context of a Commotion node. For example, expected behavior in this report was that ""Auto-Refresh On"" meant that the list of ""Nearby Mesh Devices"" or their ETX values would be automatically updated.

2490,Commotion-admin, [luci-commotion] Check for unsaved changes prior,"Wed, 19 Feb 2014 10:38:56 -0800",-0800,critzo,"This issue was originally submitted to the Commotion website by @andygunn in post-testing of the 1.0 release.

When using the Add and Delete buttons for adding and removing interfaces, if a user adds a new interface, then changes her mind and uses the Delete button to remove it, but did not actually Confirm and Apply the interface, the default configuration is actually deleted. We should check on the feasibility of saving and applying queued changes before the Delete command is executed, to ensure a user is deleting the change they intended. See the use case description originally submitted below.

We were checking a few settings in:
Basic Configuration -> Network Settings -> Mesh Networks

The ""Add"" button was clicked, then the new interface was deleted right away with the ""Delete"" button, before clicking save. The admin panel then takes the user to a confirm changes dialogue, at which point the Status menu comes back up.

The Commotion mesh interface appears to be completely removed at this point, and it isn't clear how to re-create it.
**Please describe what behavior you expected:**
The expected behavior is to remove the second mesh interface that was created by clicking add. It isn't clear that this interface hasn't been initialized, and that clicking delete will actually remove the original mesh interface.

In order to fix the issue, we had to reset the device to defaults in the Advanced menu tree.
**Please describe what behavior you experienced that you believe is wrong:**
It isn't clear why additional mesh interfaces are set up in this manner. There isn't a way to select other network interfaces (such as Ethernet), it only defaults to the single wireless connection in the device.

Recommend removing the ""Add"" and ""Delete"" buttons from this menu completely, as it is quite simple to destroy the Commotion mesh connection.

Access Point: CassCo.Co-AMP-AP (Unsecured) -- 1 client connected
Mesh Link: Commotion (Secured) -- 0 Neighbor Connections

Also, the format of having information in parentheses is a bit unclear. We should revisit what to display if the interface is enabled/disabled and the network's security status.

# Testing Instructions #

## Router Prep
* Flash two routers with a build that uses the *issue_150* branch of  *luci-commotion*
* In the next step SKIP the additional network interfaces section by pressing the finish button when you get to the section below
* Run setup wizard on both devices configuring their mesh-networks to mesh with each other 

![finish_button](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1226247/2221205/1a932822-9a56-11e3-98c4-424c88fe3e26.png)

* Connect to one device using the Wireless AP
* Check the *Status --> Nearby Mesh Devices* page on that device to ensure that both devices are meshed wirelessly.

![wireless_mesh](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1226247/2221257/93ccd47c-9a56-11e3-8958-bec7d5b8a4f3.png)

* Connect both devices  to each other using an ethernet cable
*  Using the mesh-ip address of the other given to you on the status page of the first device connect to the second device.

### WIRELESSLY OVER THE MESH ON THE SECOND DEVICE ###

** log in to the *Administration* menu
** go to menu: *Basic Configuration --> Additional Network Interfaces*
** Click the checkbox under ""Will you be meshing with other Commotion devices over the ethernet interface?""

![add_eth_gw](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1226247/2221285/ebfe950e-9a56-11e3-8026-6a68975bbb0c.png)

** Set the ip address. [ I used 10.0.1.2 ]
** Set the netmask to 255.255.255.0
** The confirmation page should look somthing like the below.

![eth-confirm-changes](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1226247/2221304/19cf94d8-9a57-11e3-9bc0-3741ff722018.png)

### ON THE ORIGINAL NODE ###

* go to menu: Basic Configuration --> Additional Network Interfaces
* Click the checkbox under ""Will you be meshing with other Commotion devices over the ethernet interface?""
* Set the ip address to one in the same range *BUT NOT THE EXACT SAME IP AS* the ip address on the old node. [ I used 10.0.1.3 ]
* Set the netmask to 255.255.255.0
* Save and confirm the settings

* At this point the mesh viz is going to look weird.

![weird_viz](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1226247/2221317/5e25335e-9a57-11e3-9b55-93e7d190fbdd.png)

* On both nodes go to the menu Advanced --> Network --> Firewall 
*  In the zones section on the bottom of the page you should see ""wired"" listed in the ""mesh"" zone

![multi_zone](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1226247/2221336/a1caec02-9a57-11e3-80a1-99a992004dc5.png)

* On both nodes go to the menu Advanced --> Status --> OLSR --> Routes
* In the overview of currently known routes you should see a route to each other over the ip-address range that you specified. 

![multi_olsr_routes](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1226247/2221359/c433ca16-9a57-11e3-8644-68d25fd716bc.png)

* If your node is working at this point you should turn off the wireless meshing on each device.

### ON THE SECOND DEVICE OVER THE WIRELESS MESH ###

** Go to *Basic (if coming from the advanced menu) --> Basic Configuration --> Mesh Network*
** On the upper-right of the mesh interface shown will be a delete button. Click that button.

![delete_mesh](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1226247/2221377/02ea202a-9a58-11e3-9be9-909493450d4c.png)

** You will be taken to a changed page which will show the following.

![eth-changed](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1226247/2221389/1f8b6658-9a58-11e3-9f20-1bc8e0981f5e.png)

** Click save, and DO NOT wait for the changes to be applied. The connection is about to be broken to that ip address. So, after about 30 seconds you can leave that page

### ON THE FIRST DEVICE ###

* At this point the second device will fall off the mesh network.
* Now you will turn off the wireless meshing on the first device.
* Go to *Basic (if coming from the advanced menu) --> Basic Configuration --> Mesh Network*
* On the upper-right of the mesh interface shown will be a delete button. Click that button.
* Click save. Unlike the device that we changed over the mesh network WAIT for this page to finish applying changes.

### REBOOT BOTH ROUTERS ###

* Once both nodes come back online go to the access point of one node.
* On the status page you will see the other node listed as a neighbor

* At this point you have confirmed that the nodes are meshing over ethernet using the wired-ethernet address you set in the additional network interfaces section.

![eth-connected](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1226247/2221405/556e6874-9a58-11e3-965f-3ad768731ca2.png)

* You can also confirm that they are meshed using the following.

======= TRAFFIC TEST ========
* Go to Advanced (if you are in the basic menu) --> Network --> Diagnostics
* Type in the ethernet ip-address of the node that fell off the network in the ""ping"" field and press the ""ping"" button.

2498,Commotion-admin, [commotion-router] dnsmasq networking error,"Thu, 20 Feb 2014 12:58:31 -0800",-0800,Josh King,"@westbywest, I suspect that that cronjob is not to restart dnsmasq when it crashes, but rather to get it to reload its configuration file. This might be needed when, say, /var/run/hosts_olsr is updated.

On further testing of this issue, I think the issue wasn't that dnsmasq caused networking to not come up, but the other way around. The debug logs indicate the mesh interface didn't come up, so /tmp/resolved.conf.auto wasn't populated, which may have been why an empty table was returned to luci by dnsmasq. Since the logs don't indicate why the mesh backhaul didn't come up, and it may have been due to an issue already fixed (and because the luci issue was fixed), I'm going to close this issue and aim to find the original problem if it still exists during rigorous stability testing for v1.1.

However, there is a problem with application advertisements. Only local advertisements show up, and when running commotion-service-manager manually it gives the following relevant output:

```

Apparently, even local advertisements are not actually being validated. Remote advertisements give the same output (with the exception of the 'Application is local' part). Running commotiond from the commandline in parallel gives no particular output, but it was not compiled with debugging.

2594,Commotion-admin, [commotiond] Add unsafe tree and list insert,"Tue, 25 Feb 2014 10:58:05 -0800",-0800,Josh King,"Commotiond, for efficiency reasons, tries to avoid doing copies of data structures where possible. Therefore, the network responses to some commands are serialized directly out of the standing data structures where it stores, for instance, profile information. Unfortunately, a recent bugfix revealed that halloc is not behaving as expected, and so some of those standing data structures were getting deleted as responses were getting freed. This pull request adds unsafe versions of the tree and list insert functions, which are functionally identical other than that they don&#39;t attempt to hattach new objects to those data structures; memory management is left up to the programmer. These are now used within certain areas of daemon.c so that we can still free all response objects but still access the standing data structures with impunity without worry of freeing them by accident.

To test:
1. Run `commotion help` and verify that the output is as expected.
2. Run it a second time and verify that the &#39;help&#39; output is identical.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for the &#39;get&#39;, &#39;profiles&#39; and &#39;state&#39; commands.

git, svn, ncurses, zlib, awk, XML::Parser 

We should provide a bit of background on needing a Linux environment to build Commotion Router, and provide instructions for Debian systems (including Ubuntu, Mint, etc).
We can instruct people to run something like:
""apt-get install subversion build-essential libncurses5-dev zlib1g-dev gawk git ccache gettext libssl-dev xsltproc""
""Additional packages may be required if errors occur during the build process:
""apt-get install libxml-parser-perl""

- GSM should change to our OpenBTS / OsmoBTS resource pages - ""Open Basestation development guide""

2632,Commotion-admin, [olsrd-mdp] Nodes without access to a time server,"Wed, 26 Feb 2014 14:43:25 -0800",-0800,Seamus Tuohy,"This is a known bug, but on mesh networks  where there is no gateway any node not set up in very close temporal proximity will not be able to mesh using serval-mdp.

Fixing this requires either:
  *  Instructions letting people know that they must set up a ntpd server on their non-gateway connected network's, and how to do it.
  * A system for having mesh nodes check for an ntpd server on a mesh if one does not exist.
  * I am partial to the first option

To recreate: 

Set up nodes a day or two apart without access to gateway. Ensure they are far enough apart in date by using the date command.

root at NODE01:/# date
```
Tue Feb 25 22:05:48 UTC 2014
```
root at NODE02:/# date
```
Tue Feb 26 02:25:57 UTC 2014
```

If they are far enough apart, and share a serval key-ring they should still not be able to mesh. 

Ensure that they can see each other:

root at test-001-1011232331:~# ip neighbor list

```
var auto_declump = true; 
```

Because the checkbox needs to be clicked to activate the set_autodeclump function that controls the auto-spacer it now requires two clicks to unset the auto-spacing.

To fix this issue we must either revert the above commit so that the checkbox accurately reflects the initial state of auto_declump or add our own version of olsr-viz.js to the repository that has auto_declump set to false.

For example, 1 minute would result in `ClientIdleTimeout 1` while 1 hour should result in `ClientIdleTimeout 60`.

The results for hours and days have been swapped, so setting resplash to 1 hour results in `ClientIdleTimeout 1440`, while setting to 1 day results in `ClientIdleSplash 60`.

Also, timeout in seconds rounds down to the nearest whole number, making that range effectively useless. Probably best just to drop it.

This commit adds the removal and re-creation of the serval mdp key to the loadPlugin creation process. This will force a key to be created when a user clicks the add button.

To Test: 
1) Flash a node with this branch included
2) Complete the setup wizard
3) Go to the ?Basic ?&gt; Security ?&gt; Shared Mesh Keychain? menu
4) SSH into the device and type the following on the command line
```
SERVALINSTANCE_PATH=/etc/commotion/keys.d/mdp serval-client keyring list
```
5) Keep the value that is given to you. That is the current (default) keyring.
6) In the menu Click the add button
7) type the same command in again
```
SERVALINSTANCE_PATH=/etc/commotion/keys.d/mdp serval-client keyring list
```
8) The output should be different at this point. This means that it is a new keyring.
9) Click the &quot;Save&quot; button
10) The value for &quot;olsrd.cfg144e54.sid=...&quot; should match the latest key.  If it does, then you should merge this pull request as I have fulfilled my aim of fixing this bug.

This is happening even with 3MB of zram swap, and furthermore even with vm.swappiness=0 specified in /etc/sysctl.conf.  Although, noticeably fewer crashes with swappiness turned all the way down.

When the hostapd or wpa_supplicant processes crash, you will see whichever wireless wireless VIF that process manages (e.g. the mesh adhoc VIF, the private AP) become unresponsive, even though the SSID remains visible.  Note the process names ""hostapd"" and ""wpa_supplicant"" appear in the process table, regardless of if you're using the wpad or wpad-mini packages.

You can verify such crashes with the presence of files like these in /tmp:
/tmp/wpa_supplicant.1497.11.1393700006.core
/tmp/hostapd.1336.11.1384486446.core

1. In your browser, go to Admin &gt; Client Controls and change the Time Until Welcome Page is Shown to 1 hour.
2. &quot;Seconds&quot; should not be an available option.
3. Click Save, then Save &amp; Apply.
4. SSH in and run `ndsctl status`. If you see actual nodogsplash data, the fix worked. If the fix didn&#39;t work you will see `ndsctl: nodogsplash probably not started (Error: Connection refused)`.
5. Open /etc/nodogsplash/nodogsplash.conf. ClientIdleTimeout and ClientForceTimeout should each be set to 60.

2878,Commotion-admin, [commotiond] Add fixes for OpenWRT DHCP modes,"Thu, 06 Mar 2014 11:57:44 -0800",-0800,Josh King,"This pull request applies some minor fixes to the DHCP modes &#39;client&#39; and &#39;none,&#39; namely to ensure that interfaces are properly removed from the client bridge and only receive an IP address if manually configured in mode &#39;none,&#39; and so that udhcpc is executed with the correct parameters in mode &#39;client.&#39; These changes allow for proper manual gateway configuration and for meshing over ethernet to function correctly. This should fix https://github.com/opentechinstitute/luci-commotion/issues/173 and 
https://github.com/opentechinstitute/luci-commotion/issues/174.

Additionally, the unused uci_state parameter &#39;lease&#39; is removed by this commit.

To test:
1. Configure two Commotion nodes through the setup wizard, and then under the &#39;additional network interfaces&#39; page, choose to have them mesh over ethernet. Set one with the address 192.168.55.1 and the other with 192.168.55.2, netmask 255.255.255.0.
2. Connect the two nodes together via ethernet, and ensure that routes for the addresses specified above show up on each of their status pages.
3. Under additional interfaces on one node, deselect the option to mesh over ethernet and then save. Make sure you can still connect to the node via its access point.
4. On that same node, under additional interfaces, select for its interface to always attempt to get a DHCP lease and save. Connect it to an upstream gateway over ethernet, and make sure it gets a lease.
5. Reboot the node, and then make sure that you do not get a lease when connecting to it via ethernet.

The patch does two things: one, it modifies the redirect path to be &#39;thisnode&#39; in cases where settings aren&#39;t saved during a reflash, whereas with the default version it is &#39;192.168.1.1.&#39; Two, it increases the interval at which the page checks to see if the node is back up to 15 seconds instead of 5. The first interval was too short, as with SSL and the other stuff we&#39;re running, uhttpd hasn&#39;t even shut down within 5 seconds, so it redirects immediately and then breaks. 10 seconds seems just enough (uhttpd shut down in tests in about 8 seconds), but I increased it to 15 to allow time for slower or more overloaded devices.

This should fix the issue seen in https://github.com/opentechinstitute/commotion-router/issues/112

To test:
1. Run a sysupgrade through the LuCI interface on a configured node. Either keep or don&#39;t keep settings.
2. You should see the redirect page until after the flashing process is complete and the node has rebooted. Some short time after the node has finished booting up, you should automatically be redirected to its front page.

-- Commit Summary --

  * Moved ui GUI objects into ui folder within GUI directory to remove clutter.c
  * Created a restart window object to avoid a full close of the application when a restart closes all other windows.
  * Made GUI module imports not attempt to import classes, and instead import the module and then call the classes as needed.
  * Added a default exit_on_close value to avoid errors where it is checked before being called.
  * added a generic thread class and extended it to allow for the application to keep its state during a restart and therefore not shutdown when all its windows are removed.
  * removed the graphical restart window in favor of a simple thread.
  * seperated the system tray and the main window in the commotion client
  * seperated the system tray from the main window
  * Changed old signal events to new style and moved them to application control functions.
  * see: last commit but re: main application code
  * added exceptions to system tray start and init functions
  * removed empty extension file from last commit
  * got system tray connected and working correctly with the main window
  * split out the single applicaiton classes from the main commotion_client code file
  * implemented a close function for the system tray to ensure that it is fully cleaned up for the restart.
  * fixing whitespace
  * Added an exit function and replaced all existing sys.exit functions with it.
  * Replaced sys.exit in critical error functions with QApplication.exit which will pass the error message to sys.exit after its clean up anyway.
  * Made ending the restart thread more indirect
  * Made main window called more indirectly and gathered main window functions together in the application.
  * organized the code to make it more readable
  * added a clean up function to the main window to allow proper clean up without forcing other parts of the application to know how to do it properly for this object

Yes. This was a note I'd added pre-R1, but hadn't committed for some reason. Part of the larger CSS refactoring/streamlining needs to be removal of invalid pseudoclasses (which seem like a hack around Firefox).

This should also create a serval-key on account creation keyed with the same password.

This will require that when a user changes their password that the serval key is copied into a new key with the new password.

3079,Commotion-admin, [commotion-client] User extensions need to be by,"Wed, 26 Mar 2014 14:39:03 -0700",-0700,Seamus Tuohy,"Currently ""User"" are the different log-in's on an OS. Users should be the commotion log-ins under each log-in. This will allow for shared computers to have different user settings. 

The example below shows four ""users"" (1,2,3,4). Each user can have custom settings and extensions. User's 1 & 2 can only access their account when logged in to the computer as ""Operating System User A."" Also, users 1 & 2 

EG:
  * Operating System User A
    * Commotion Login 1
    * Commotion Login 2
  * Operating System User B
    * Commotion Login 3
    * Commotion Login 4

The ""settings"" values in utile/extension_manager.py will be impacted by this.

**Possible Solution:**
1) Save all user specific settings with a proper [User Scope](http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt4/qsettings.html#Scope-enum) to ensure proper ""OS User Scope"" and then create a settings section that uses the currently logged in user as a key to check for ""Commotion user"" specific settings.

2) Use the ""User Scope"" from 1, but also have all settings saved using python-gpg and the users key. As such, each login is connected to a gpg-encrypted .ini file. Upon creation of a new user a gpg key is created using the users password. Upon login, when the user enters their login and password the gpg-key file associated with that login is loaded using that password by the commotion_client. If the key is loaded, and the .ini file is decrypted then the login succeeds. If it does not, then the login fails. Upon closing the .ini file is re-encrypted using the key. This would have to be built in as a fail-safe to ensure that even upon a crash the users data is only decrypted when using the application. This way all authentication is done through the python-gpg library and not re-implemented through commotion. We would need to ensure that the gpg code we write is audited.

3292,Commotion-admin, [commotion-docs] Adjust CSS for images in CCK,"Fri, 18 Apr 2014 08:41:22 -0700",-0700,andygunn,"It looks like the CSS stylesheet is putting all images at 100%, instead of following the height/width information in the image tag. This makes some of the images really huge (when browser widths are large) on the CCK pages. For example: [Gather Tools and Wireless Equipment](http://www.commotionwireless.net/docs/cck/building-mounting/gather-tools-and-wireless-equipment/).

On a large monitor, the header image scales up and becomes pixelated. The individual small pics of tools do the same thing. The exception is ""6-in-1 Screwdriver"", which appears to have a different style or something that respects the static sizing.

Let me know if you have questions about how to fix, this - I think some of the classes might need to be set to be static, or just to disable scaling on some of them...

3299,Commotion-admin, [commotion-router] Rate limit ssh attempts to WAN,"Fri, 18 Apr 2014 12:47:11 -0700",-0700,areynold,"Incorporates firewall changes suggested by @raniarho in #116 with some modifications.
Partially addresses #30.

To test:
1. Flash the node and configure it as a gateway
2. Log in and make note of the public-facing IP address.
3. Connect another machine to the same network as the node, but not to the node itself. You should not receive an IP address from the node or be inside the commotion network.
4. SSH to the node and enter an invalid password until you are disconnected (3 attempts), then immediately repeat. On the fourth attempt within 1 minute your connection should be denied.

Previously all GTests were run as a single CTest under &#39;make test&#39;, but now they are split out individually for more useful output. Additionally, unit tests are now run by default as part of the build process.

To test:
1. Create a clean build. You should see the unit tests as part of the build process output.
2. Run &#39;make test.&#39; You should see several individual tests run instead of just one test.

Already tested by @areynold, @dismantl, and @hawkinswnaf.
Assigning to @technosopher to merge, since it will require a build server toolchain rebuild.

Instructions:
1. Add `src-git areynold git://github.com/areynold/commotion-feed.git` to feeds.conf. (ssp_test does not need to be merged.)
2. `./setup.sh`
3. `cd openwrt`
4. `make menuconfig`
4a. Select Commotion &gt; Utilities &gt; ssp_test, which includes SSP compile flags in its Makefile. (Note: I have occasionally had to deselect and reselect Advanced Configuration Options &gt; Toolchain Options &gt; Enable Stack-Smashing-Protection to make the test utility available.)
4b. Save and exit
5. make V=s
6. Flash router. 
7. Telnet to router. No need to run through setup wizard.
8. `cd /root`
9. Run `./smash` to find the address of the vulnerable function. Note that the address format is 0x followed by 8 digits. You only need the digits after &quot;0x&quot;. If smash provides fewer than 8, pad the address with 0s as needed. Also note that you will need to reverse the address on little-endian machines. See examples below.
10. Smash will display a 4-character string. Re-enter the string. Smash should abort with the &quot;stack smashing detected&quot; error.
11. Run smash and enter a 3-character string. Smash should print your string and exit normally.
12. Type `printf &quot;meat\x01\x12\x23\x34\x01\x12\x23\x34\x01\x12\x23\x34\x01\x12\x23\x34 | ./smash`.  If the package was compiled with SSP, smash will abort with the message `*** stack smashing detected ***: smash terminated
Trace/breakpoint trap`. If not, it will execute the target function and print a message to the screen.
13. Run through setup wizard and confirm standard function tests (node meshes, etc.).

Alternately, you can run `strings ./smash` and grep for &quot;__stack_chk_fail&quot;, but that&#39;s not nearly as cool.

Examples:
If smash returns 0x804849d, you will first need to pad the address (making it 0804849d).

On a big-endian device (such as ubiquiti routers) you would enter \x08\x04\x84\x9d.
On a little-endian device (such as x86) you would enter \x9d\x84\x04\x08.

There's no 'state' option in the OpenWRT wiki's page about the UCI firewall, as far as I can see. Is this an undocumented option?

It's intentional. I wasn't totally sure whether I could put two state options in a single config rule, but it seems to work. I could break it out if you want.

Huh. I could have sworn I read it on one of the openwrt wiki pages or forum posts but now I can't find it. State is supported by iptables. The closest I can find in the UCI documentation is ""The iptables rules generated for this section rely on the state match."" I must have guessed at it.

However, there are devices such as the Mikrotik RB450G which could function well as mesh-over-ethernet devices, paired with other wireless routers. Commotion Router can be installed on these devices, but the Commotion Setup Wizard presents luci/lua errors when loading pages that look for wireless devices.

Enhance the Commotion Setup Wizard by adding checks on appropriate pages that include the use case of a device with no wireless cards.This will allow for full completion of the Setup Wizard on such devices. This feature request could be paired with an enhanced version that allows a user to choose ethernet interfaces to use for meshing as well.

The relevant files to check are:
* basic_mn.lua
* basic_wn.lua
* client_wp.lua
* security_pass.lua

""I would add – TRY TO ENGAGE ANY LOCAL AMATEUR (HAM) RADIO OPERATORS  – we use a very similar concept  with something called HamNet Broadband   (http://www.broadband-hamnet.org/). Not all Hams will be familiar with it but when it comes to running cable and mounting antennas they will have all sorts of experience and tools. We typically have a strong sense of community service and this is the sort of thing we would be attracted to.  In addition you can find a ham almost anywhere in the world short of North Korea.

""Zip Ties should be UV – rated.  I would add this means they will be black in color and the reason you want UV rated ones is to prevent the plastic breaking down in the sun.

Under the `Spool of Ethernet Cable` that it should be outdoor rated and gives a specific supplier and part number - you should stress the cable needs to be outdoor rated to prevent it breaking down in a year when exposed to the elements.

Under the anchor mounting instructions it mentions plastic anchors – on concrete or masonry either lead anchors or fasteners specifically designed for the application (like Tapcons) are much better. We found plastic anchors just slid out of the hole.""

This comes from a public comment, and the full text is below:

""When running the cable be careful not to deform it with fasteners – zipties installed too tightly or incorrect staples as well as being aware of bend radius; using a grommet when running the cable through a wall and reinforcing the cable when running it over an edge (reinforcing it with multiple layers of electrical tape or something similar).

I’d also suggest that it should be mentioned that best practice (which may not be able to be achieved in a developing nation) would be the use of shielded cable (and connectors) and installing a lightning arrestor – especially if the radio is mounted outside and is the highest point on the building.""

Although it does turn on meshing over ethernet, it also disabled meshing over the wireless interface, and turns off the olsrd dynamic gateway plugin. It also presents the user with IP address and Netmask text fields and turns of DHCP.

The page should instead simply add the wired interface to the list of olsrd interfaces, and leave the IP addressing and wireless mesh unmodified, as multiple nodes meshing over a switch (https://commotionwireless.net/docs/cck/installing-configuring/common-configuration/#”several-commotion-nodes-connected-through-a-switch-or-router”) is a more common scenario than two nodes meshed over an ethernet cable (https://commotionwireless.net/docs/cck/installing-configuring/common-configuration/#two-wireless-nodes-meshed-over-an-ethernet-connection).

""
Note: Mounting two wireless routers back-to-back on the same pole can cause interference. For best performance, we recommend:
1. Mounting equipment on separate poles. A separation of two or three meters (6 to 10 feet) can make a big difference in reducing the amount of wireless interference.
2. Using metal shields on the back of directional nodes. These reduce the wireless signal radiated from the back of the equipment, reducing the interference. You can buy these [http://www.rfarmor.com/cart/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=12&products_id=30](commercially), or make your own from metal building studs.

This is fine for a prototype, but to provide better extendability and usability, we also need a tab to open as well. 

When a user opens/closes the M-Lab Browser extension, the current sidebar and a browser tab should both open and close. 

The Tab should initially contain user-facing text on how to use this thing (to be written) and maybe some stuff about M-Lab generally. This content will change when links in the Sidebar are clicked.

The Sidebar should consist of navigation and preferences, per test.
 - Logo should be a clickable link that takes the sidebar and tab back to their opening states
 - Available tests are listed by name with a link. Clicking the name should expose content in the Tab which is currently in the sidebar for NDT. Tab should have brief explanation of the test, link to the preferences for the test, visualization of past tests and listing of results, along with controls for selecting the range of results shown. 
 - Additional features might include an action button that exports the tests run from this browser and allows the user to save them as a text file

What you will need:

* Two picostations
* The image with the CLI (It requires special build instructions right now, so please ask me for a copy)


Now let&#39;s test!

Flash both nodes with the CLI image

Router 1:
Set up the first node using the regular graphical Set Up Wizard, as you normally would, using the following values:

Node Name:
DrBunsenHoneydew

Mesh SSID:
MuppetMesh

Channel:
11

Mesh Encryption:
MuppetMesh

Access Point SSID:
DrBunsenHoneydew

Access Point Encryption:
MuppetAP


Router 2:

Follow these instructions:

Flash Router

Switch to DHCP

... to get a lease (ip address) from the node once it boots up

On command line

Determine your node&#39;s IP address

~ ifconfig

Copy the IP address used by the eth0 interface and change the last octet to .1

~ telnet 10.48.162.1 

Run the setup wizard:

~ setupwizard

Use the following values for the second node. We will be trying bad values to make sure that it refuses bad inputs.

New password:
muppetshow

Set Hostname?
First Try:
Meep

Second Try:
y

Host Name:

First Try:
%!^@!^

Second Try:
Beaker

Mesh SSID:

First Try:
(Nothing. Just hit enter)

Second Try:
MuppetMesh

Channel:

First Try:
9001

Second Try:
11

Mesh Encryption:
y

First Try:
Meep

Second Try:
MuppetMesh


Set up an access point?
y

Access Point SSID:
Beaker

Access Point Encryption:
BeakerAP


Keep this configuration?
n  (sorry, but we have to go through it again)

Hostname:
NoBeaker

Mesh SSID:
NoMuppetMesh

Channel:
5

Mesh Encryption:
NoMuppetMesh

Access Point SSID:
NoBeaker

Access Point Encryption:
NoBeakerAP

Keep this configuration?
y


Your node will now restart networking and should after a minute or so begin broadcasting an access point.

Connect to the &quot;NoBeaker&quot; access point, then go back to the command line:

~ ssh root at thisnode 

OR

~ ssh root@[IP address we used to telnet in]

Once you&#39;re reconnected, rerun the set up wizard:

~ setupwizard

Set new configuration?
y

Run back through the set up wizard with the following configuration:

Node Name:
Beaker

Mesh SSID:
MuppetMesh

Channel:
11

Mesh Encryption:
MuppetMesh

Access Point SSID:
Beaker

Access Point Encryption:
MuppetAP


Your node will now restart networking and should after a minute or so begin broadcasting an access point. But NOW we should be able to mesh with Dr.BunsenHoneydew

Connect to the &quot;Beaker&quot; access point, then go back to the command line:

~ ssh root at thisnode 

OR

~ ssh root@[IP address we used to telnet in]

Once you&#39;re logged in, type:

~ route

You should see in the table a route to DrBunsenHoneydew

Essentially the same way that lua.model.uci has some functions that are just C code that can be imported when calling Lua code.

3749,Commotion-admin, [commotion-router] Firewall rule preventing,"Sat, 21 Jun 2014 07:43:49 -0700",-0700,Dan Staples,"At the AMC MagicNet, we have nodes meshing both over ethernet and wirelessly. Node A at the ""end"" of the network is meshed to node B over wifi, and B is then meshed to the rest of the network over ethernet. From further inside the network, as a client on an access point, I am not able to route traffic to/from node A. I was able to fix this by changing the following firewall rules in `/etc/config/firewall` on node B:

    config zone
            option name 'mesh'
            option input 'ACCEPT'
            option output 'ACCEPT'
            option forward 'DROP'
            list network 'commotionwireless_46net'
            list network 'mesh'
    
    config zone
            option name 'wan'
            option input 'DROP'
            option output 'ACCEPT'
            option forward 'DROP'
            option masq '1'
            list network 'wired'

to:

    config zone
            option name 'mesh'
            option input 'ACCEPT'
            option output 'ACCEPT'
            option forward 'ACCEPT'
            list network 'commotionwireless_46net'
            list network 'mesh'
    
    config zone
            option name 'wan'
            option input 'DROP'
            option output 'ACCEPT'
            option forward 'ACCEPT'
            option masq '1'
            list network 'wired'

Perhaps, once we add an option to the basic config to mesh over ethernet, turning that on should change the firewall rules of the node accordingly.

3754,Commotion-admin, [commotiond] Lua bindings (#46),"Tue, 24 Jun 2014 11:18:10 -0700",-0700,Josh King,"Hi @legontanon , that would be really great! The only API that exists right now is the C client API. Right now, this is essentially just a barebones API for connecting to a running commotion daemon instance, sending it requests, and receiving responses. You can find the API in src/commotion.h, and the doxygen documentation at https://commotionwireless.net/developer/api/commotiond/html/commotion_8h.html. That might be a good starting point. 

Eventually, we'd like to add support for the language bindings directly. For instance, the commotion daemon supports a number of different commands, some of which are built in and some of which are loaded from plugins. In order to call any of them right now, you would use the client API to marshal the command and its arguments, and then receive the result back. However, a binding in a language like lua could actually directly have functions for things like getting configuration values, signing keys, etc. Those functions would then use the C client API on the backend.

Additionally, we're also working on a 'core API,' which would involve splitting out the libcommotion 'standard library' from the daemon, and consolidating its headers into a structured API for using it's functionality, like network abstraction and JSON serialization/deserialization. It's a little bit further out, so it's not as certain what that would look like.

3793,Commotion-admin, [commotiond] Lua bindings (#46),"Tue, 01 Jul 2014 22:28:31 -0700",-0700,LEGO,"I'm working a quick and dirty wrapper around co_obj_t and family... Just to get started.. Few obserbations:

I find unconfortable that  co_obj_t's ""extended subtypes"" have a different struct wrapper aroud them (with common elements)...
I was thinking is wrapping all extension subtypes of co_obj_t in 

typedef struct co_extobj_t {
  co_obj_t _header;
  uint8_t _exttype;
  uint8_t _len;
} co_extobj_t;

and then refactor all subtypes for it:
i.e.
struct co_iface_t {
  co_extobj_t _header;
...
} __attribute__((packed));

Nothing changes in the way data is layout, so it shouldn't have any impact, but this allows for easier constructs dealing generically with extended objects.

Then to the main issue:
As with Wireshark an issue here is how to deal with the different lifespan of objects in the environment and in the language, so that garbage-collection on either side of the thing does not leave broken pointers on the other side.

I haven't studied the issue yet as currently I'm more involved with finding the ""patterns"" for the macros for adding easily the API to Lua .

My question is obj type _ptr already thought for ?
It be so nice to use it for keeping references to an object, so that we can tell Lua the pointer is invalid when the other side deletes it.

3806,Commotion-admin, [luci-commotion] Additional Network,"Fri, 11 Jul 2014 09:47:38 -0700",-0700,andygunn,"Another option is to change this from ""Additional Network Interfaces"" to ""Ethernet Interfaces"" or ""Wired Interfaces"", and have sections to assign the functionality of the Ethernet port(s), and whether they are advertised gateways.

This would provide more clarity when there are multiple Ethernet interfaces, or a switch on the device - as is the case with the TP-Link WDR series devices, and the Buffalo devices. Some ports are switched LAN ports that may just have DHCP on by default. Some ports (such as the case of a single-port device or a device with a WAN port) will be Commotion default or DHCP clients only. These should still be possible to configure with static IPs and have meshing via Ethernet as option as well, as @dismantl suggests above.

A suggestion on the layout:

## Ethernet Ports
If desired, you can configure your Ethernet (wired) interfaces here.

### eth0 - WAN
This is the main Ethernet port on the device.

#### Mesh on this Interface
If this device is wired to other Commotion devices directly or through a switch or router, you can enable meshing over Ethernet.
( ) - Enable mesh over Ethernet
(x) - Disable mesh over Ethernet

#### IP configuration:
How will this interface's IP address be configured?
(x) - Commotion default: Try and aquire an IP address with DHCP. If it succeeds, configure as a gateway. If it times out, hand out IP addresses on this port with DHCP.
( ) - Only receive IP addresses on this interface. Will be configured as a DHCP client only.
( ) - Only hand out IP addresses on this interface. It will be configured as a DHCP server only.
( ) - Manually provide a static IP address. (upon selection input fields will appear)

#### Gateway advertisement
By default, Commotion shares connections to the Internet if they are detected. If you wish, you can allow connections to the Internet only from the local access point or Ethernet ports.
(x) - Enable Gateway advertisement from this interface to the mesh.
( ) - Disable Gateway advertisement from this interface.

### eth1 - LAN
These are the switched Ethernet port(s) on the device.

#### Mesh on this Interface
If this device is wired to other Commotion devices directly or through a switch or router, you can enable meshing over Ethernet.
( ) - Enable mesh over Ethernet
(x) - Disable mesh over Ethernet

#### IP configuration:
How will this interface's IP address be configured?
( ) - Commotion default: Try and aquire an IP address with DHCP. If it succeeds, configure as a gateway. If it times out, hand out IP addresses on this port with DHCP.
( ) - Only receive IP addresses on this interface. Will be configured as a DHCP client only.
(x) - Only hand out IP addresses on this interface. It will be configured as a DHCP server only.
( ) - Manually provide a static IP address. (upon selection input fields will appear)

We will need to investigate which MAC address (lan0, radio0, wan0, eth0, etc) is the right one to include as routers with multiple interfaces have MAC addresses for each interface. Ideally we want the MAC address in the status page to match the address listed on the external packaging of the router.

Right now I'm into writing a ""good"" Lua api code generator[1] ( one that's light and versatile, the ones I've tested in the past aren't good for one reason(usu. slow code) or the other(lack of versatility) ), simply because I know overall it will be cheaper to write and test the code generator, and then use it for doing the whole thing, reducing the overall times of debugging compared with those of non generated code.


In the meanwhile we probably want to define how the flags are to be used in regards of GC, because some of what I got to do with the flags for Lua is exactly knowing when to invoke a destructor and how and when just to purge the object from Lua.

However, given that you should always pull the most up-to-date files from Transifex before checking for updated strings (so that when you later upload the files, you aren't overwriting new translations in Transifex), this imposes a few additional unnecessary steps (i.e., you should download files from Transifex, add them to luci-i18n-commotion, run this script, upload to transifex, download the files, and add them to luci-i18n-commotion _again_). It would be much better if this script pulled the current .po files from Transifex directly using their API, rather than pulling the (potentially already old) files from luci-i18n-commotion as a starting point.

Strings must be a 100% match, including punctuation and line breaks, to be caught by the check. LuCI's translate function also requires a 100% match in order to swap the correct translation.

It would be great if the script could check for similar strings or near matches, allowing developers to correct minor formatting issues or reuse existing strings and translations elsewhere in the UI, and minimizing duplication of effort by the translators.

There's a thread on PerlMonks about [fuzzy text matching]](http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=816086) that might serve as a good starting point.

However, when you look at the bridge configuration for the `br-lan` interface in the Web UI, it only shows the `wlan0` interface in configuration. This is not only inaccurate, but it makes it impossible to remove the `eth0` interface from the bridge without using the command line, thus preventing the user from manually configuring the ethernet interface.
