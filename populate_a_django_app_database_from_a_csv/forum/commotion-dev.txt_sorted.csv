For the list archives.  This was an earlier conversation on a basic dev

In summary, two groups. One group working to update the olsr ports
(http://www.olsr.org/?q=download) for windows, os x, iphone and android.
 The second group to work on improving the OpenWRT commotion custom

3,Commotion-dev, Thoughts on secondary apps,"Tue, 1 Feb 2011 00:51:40 -0600",-0600,Erich Heine,"Hi all,

I've been doing some thinking on this whole secondary apps thing. Basically,
the main idea is to have a few easy apps, and an openwrt distro that can be
put on lots of cheap boxes to create a decent mesh. If lucky, some few main
internet uplinks can be organized for information access to and from the
outside world.  Also extremely relevant: the whole point of these networks
is to subvert governments. All of this leads to some really crazy
constraints and considerations.

First of all, consider use cases, which seem to fall naturally into some
sort of priority scheme. Here is how i see it, which is by no means a
complete, or even accurate list, but we gotta start somewhere

1. Organizing the revolution (or resistance or protests or whatnot) -- this
will probably be the most important use case for those hosting the network.
They need to communicate and make sure things are properly organized. If i
were in this situation, I would consider this the utmost importance as there
are very serious consequences (prison, death, etc) attached. This needs to
happen.

2a. Keeping the world informed -- protests and such are messy affairs. Its
usually best to be very public about all happenings, particularly when your
opponent is the government. Public and international, as you want things to
remain somewhat tame, and the easiest way to do this has historically have
""the whole world is watching"" situations (well better than the alternative
:( ).

2b. Keeping up on the rest of the word: Is the UN sending in blue helmets?
Will we get help coming in and when? Are we getting the right message out
about our goals?

3. Tell my family I am alive. People will want to share this info with
family and friends abroad.

So on top of these use cases we have some weird constraints here:

* Limited Internet connectivity. It's like the olden days but worse -- fast
LAN super slow WAN. Further that WAN link is probably pretty sketchy and
down and up a lot.

* Honest to goodness hop-count issues, and other weirdnesses from running
lots of traffic through small boxes.

* Trust issues like woah -- social trust issues between/about various
groups, mesh networks seem tailor made for MiTM situations, canonical naming
and other issues go out the window.

* Infrastructure setup issues -- even if we get a packet network up and
running on meshed devices, there needs to be a bunch of local services set
up to deal with the fact that 1. no one can reach standard infrastructure
reasonable (see the limited connectivity issues) and 2. many of the local
language services are probably run on servers that can no longer talk to the
network, and probably can't reasonably be expected to jump on the mesh.

Ok so there is a weird situation here! Honestly a huge chunk of it sounds
like a job for freenet -- otherwise we just end up cobbling something
together out of git, ssh, pgp. Other things to consider too tho:

* Batching communications for low priority transmission. Email can work this
way. Or we could do something a bit more sophisticated.

* Key parties: seriously, this network and situation almost demands giving
everyone a key and good key ring apps. Otherwise this whole thing is fairly
easily subvertable. Key signing should be trivial, as should web-of-trust
stuff. smart-phones can really help here, a nice android app devoted to key
exchanges really makes the whole thing reasonable.

* user education -- everything above needs to be teachable to the users in
some form, quickly and with minimal effort, because really, there are bigger
things afoot and the easier it is to get people ready to go, the better.

Things that sound like good ideas to consider, but probably are just easier
to solve socially:

* deciding what gets out over the uplink: really this will come down to the
uplink operator anyway, so there is no point trying to enforce it...

* factional disputes, trust of leaders, who gets the best info out: this
problem has existed far longer than the internet, the real problem is that
social upheaval is pretty much by definition messy, and as such there is no
fix by tech.

Anyway... My little thought experiment turned into a total brain dump. Hope
there is enough here to start a good discussion on this topic, and maybe
consider setting an agenda on it.

First things first, in addition to the git repo, we have some online

These are not in any sort of priority order...
- *finish* a commotion image with the basic services running and
deploy a test bed mesh within the IMC. Thanks to Brian's work this is
almost done. The test bed will be our internal testing ground for
whatever needs tested: bandwidth tests, distributed services,
whatever. We also have access to outdoor hardware and could then
expand that test mesh into downtown Urbana.
- new WRT theme. write a new frontend theme (programmed in Lua/Luci
http://luci.subsignal.org/ ) and application hooks for openwrt,
customized for commotion firmware. This isn't a huge priority, but
ties into the next item.
- write a 1-2-3 setup Lua/Luci based init script that allows easy
setup. one of the big goals that we have is a GUI frontend for the
init scripts that Josh has worked on. This would need to be simple,
allow a series of choices for a person with no technical knowledge to
fill in some details (perhaps given to them by us or someone else
technical who is deploying a mesh) that configs their device to joint
the mesh, share bandwidth, etc.
- Some talk on the list about Batman, Batman Advanced, and OpenMesh.
These are great technologies and we could certainly use them. In fact,
OTi would like to roll all of them into commotion so that the user or
group deploying a mesh could choose which protocol they want to use.
The OpenMesh dashboard is nice, and Josh has planed to roll it into
the commotion firmware.
- Why not just go with OpenMesh? I dunno, you tell me. What I've been
told is that OLSR is simply a better routing protocol, just doesn't
have the non-techie frontend yet. We're on the bleeding edge here
folks, so any direction is fine. I could see us putting together a
small OpenMesh test bed and do comparison tests with the OLSR test
bed.
- Windows OLSR client. There are old binaries on the olsr site, so we
need to build an updated one from source. this involves installing
cygwin, bison, flex, and any other dependencies, building the source
and then putting together a gui wrapper for it. The build should be
straightforward. Putting a GUI together is another. This needs to be
done.

> Im aware that getting the commotion distro up and working is part of it. As
> is ?getting the windows olsr client working. What in detail does this

- Language support as a user preference would be great. It's supported
in OpenWRT I believe. Remember that config script idea? Language
option as a choice. There's also translation to think about for any
new interface pages we write.

That's enough for now. Hope to see you all Thursday evening.

7,Commotion-dev, Critical services,"Tue, 01 Feb 2011 08:48:52 -0600",-0600,Peter Folk,"I think that this type of project would have the most effect if it
included special-case optimizations for four critical services, in order
of importance:

   1. One-to-many updates (RSS including twitter and facebook; inbound)
   2. One-to-many updates (updating twitter, facebook, etc; outbound)
   3. Short one-to-one messages (IM, SMS)
   4. Medium-length one-to-one messages (email)

The first item could be implemented as follows:

*Caching Client-Server RSS Proxy* (CSSRSSP)
In net-accessible areas, servers run a daemon that accepts incoming SSH
connections (for compression as much as security), over which the
following protocol is run:

    * client sends monitor<space>N<cr><lf> (for int N) to indicate that
      it is monitoring N feeds.  N should be 10 digits, 0-padded on the
      left.
    * client sends N monitor notifications, consisting of
      A<space>B<space>C<space>D<cr><lf>, where A is the number of users
      monitoring the feed, B is the 64-bit UTC timestamp of the last
      update received for this feed, and C is the number of characters
      in the feed's URL, and D is that URL.  Numbers are 10, 20, and 5
      digits, respectively, 0-padded on the left, to make read() as easy
      as possible
    * server begins to monitor the feed urls, polling each feed (with
      higher frequency, down to the feeds minimum update time) in a
      round-robin fashion weighted by # of monitoring users
    * When a feed is updated, server sends A<space>B<space>C<cr><lf>,
      where A is the timestamp of the update (20 digits), B is 0 if this
      is the full feed, the length of the update (in bytes; 10 digits)
      otherwise, and C is the diff of the RSS feed from the timestamp
      last reported to be cached by this client
    * Client periodically updates server with new ""monitor N"" info.  A
      user count of 0 removes the feed from the client's list of
      monitored feeds.  Otherwise, an entry with an already-seen URL
      updates the timestamp and user count on record for that client
    * Server caches the most recent list of monitored feeds and metadata
      in a file, with name == MD5 checksum of the file
    * Client can resume a cached state (eg, after disconnection) by
      sending resume<space>A<cr><lf> with the A == the md5sum of a
      previous state, to which the server should reply either ok<cr><lf>
      if it has such a state or no<cr><lf> if it does not

On the client side, this general daemon can be used to implement a
caching twitter, facebook, and general RSS-feed proxy (each one would
require some custom code).


The second item could be implemented with custom code per updateable
service in the client-side interface to the proxy.  That might be
preferable to using standard HTTP interface because those short updates
could be prioritized above general HTTP traffic.


The third item is only hard if you actually need to proxy the sessions
to disallow or reprioritize file transfers (which should go via the same
priority as HTTP, for example).  That amount of prioritization might
come for free with classification by port with per-stream bandwidth
throttling.


The 4th item is basically a normal SMTP-hijacking mail server that is
configured to be pretty much an open relay, and deal well with being
disconnected (maybe have some batch-transfer mechanism like UUCP). 
Extra points for cacheing the login credentials and original target of
an SMTP request, so you can forward a message to its intended
destination and avoid relaying issues...

Some thoughts,
Peter

Notes:

    * the client and server's caches of monitored URLs need to be sorted
      the same to get the same MD5sum.  I suggest sort by URL.
    * in the ""When a feed is updated"" step, you need to have a boolean B
      (0 if this is the full feed, 1 if sending a diff update), and a
      separate B1 for the length of the update in bytes (left-padded 10
      digit decimal)
    * padding could be zeros or spaces; zeros would normally indicate
      octal so maybe spaces are better
    * Probably need a ""nok"" response if a line was received that the
      server doesn't grok
    * Probably need an intro ""ccsrss v1.2 foo at bar.com"" message from the
      server to announce the server version and who to contact if it's
      broken
    * My acronym was wrong =P  Should be CCSRSSP (which to me means, it
      needs a new name)
    * I think that such a client+server could be written in an evening
      in perl (and probably Python, for someone who likes it)
    * this kind of proxy would be useful for any system that's
      periodically connected, wants to monitor multiple RSS feeds, and
      usually has a slow link (like a cell phone).

It seems to me likely that a person will usually know the person
providing their gateway (multiple small disconnected cells are more
likely than a full mesh) or at least someone who knows that person (no
need for a party, which is operationally dangerous; you can have a chain
of trust).

With that in mind, you need each user to exchange a key with their
gateway host, in the form of the fingerprint for a self-signed SSL cert,
and get the direct URL of that gateway so that it can (via whatever
routing mechanism) use a secure HTTP proxy and critical service
interfaces that run on the gateway.

The gateway owner needs to get fingerprints of trusted out-of-country
proxies, ccsrssp hosts, etc.  Since the gateway operator has 'net
access, that can be PKI-based.

Yes, but reasonable defaults will make things work better:

    * On the gateway, identify uplink bandwidth with periodic
      observations and/or speed tests
    * Prioritize critical-service traffic, DNS, and known chat
      protocols, over bulk traffic
    * If the gateway only communicates with an out-of-country proxy
      (through an SSH tunnel, for example), that proxy can similarly
      prioritize gateway-bound traffic

To toss out this idea for priorities...

1) Get standard oslr mesh and tor running on the firmware.
2) Get default mesh params so that these devices are turned on and ready to go.
3) Get dashboard interface working that shows you the status of the
devices (how many mesh nodes are connected? Do I have an uplink?)
4) Get easily-reconfigured mesh param interface up.
5) Get custom caching services up.
6) Get some security (certificates perhaps) for mesh nodes and work
that into the interface for approval.

My guess is that the uplink from the gateway will be one of the most
stable components of this whole system; just very slow.  That said the
proxy I described is designed to help with flaky uplinks.

RE storage caching, it seems to me that even with relatively old
hardware you can cache a lot: 10M would hold 10k compressed smtp
messages or a similar number of RSS feeds.  I'm not talking about
caching video, or even images, for the critical services.  That might be
a reason to have the critical services proxy run on some gateways and
the general http proxy run on others (so that it can use the max
resources for caching).

Most of the people in the reading group are new to mesh, olsrd, and

if they would be interested in helping with this project.

It would be great if other folks in the Chambana area could drop by. We
could meet each other in person and have a chance to discuss the project
and engage the other members of the reading group.

So if you're in Chambana and you're free at 7 this Thursday, stop by 202

Head downstairs to the Makerspace.

some cheap routers even come with an usb port. (also, one might
manually solder an sd-card to the gpio pins to get storage beyong a
few megs to many without usb port)
lately i saw lots of those portable 3g routers, they come with small
battery pack and got ethernet, usb and wifi and are intended to be
used with 3g usb dongles -- but u could just plug a usb pen drive and
have the ideal building block for an emergency caching network... i
guess the best part is that they can survive power outages for at
least 1 or 2 hours...
all the ones i saw are based on ralink rt3052f, and coincidently,
ramips usb support was added to openwrt trunk today.

We have a new development site up for the Commotion firmware, you can
access it at http://tech.chambana.net/projects/commotion

When you register, there's space for wikis, documents, tickets, forums,

expect from that). You can also upload your ssh keys which will give you
access to the commotion repo. To check out commotion for read-only
access, do the following:

git clone http://git.chambana.net/commotion.git

Once you're registered on the site and have committer access, you can
access the source tree via:

git clone git at git.chambana.net:commotion.git

I'm working on adding in milestones, tickets, documentation, build
instructions, etc. Please let me or the list know if you have any

Not sure where this would fit in the roadmap so I didn't attempt to 
update anything on the website.

Couple thoughts:


- There's mention of GSM and LPFM on the frontpage as backbone / links 
to the rest of the Internet. Since I've been working over the past few 
days on modem access (including ""modem callback"") it would be 
interesting to envision (landline) modem access as a third [...] option.

- I think I had mentioned villagetelco[1] to Dan & Peter. The folks at 
villagetelco have produced a nice piece of _open_ hardware[2] with WAN,

would be needed instead of an FXS port. But the changes for that 
shouldn't be extremely extensive.

much insight here, though.)

36,Commotion-dev, Thoughts on secondary apps,"Tue, 1 Feb 2011 00:51:40 -0600",-0600,Erich Heine,"Hi all,

I've been doing some thinking on this whole secondary apps thing. Basically,
the main idea is to have a few easy apps, and an openwrt distro that can be
put on lots of cheap boxes to create a decent mesh. If lucky, some few main
internet uplinks can be organized for information access to and from the
outside world.  Also extremely relevant: the whole point of these networks
is to subvert governments. All of this leads to some really crazy
constraints and considerations.

First of all, consider use cases, which seem to fall naturally into some
sort of priority scheme. Here is how i see it, which is by no means a
complete, or even accurate list, but we gotta start somewhere

1. Organizing the revolution (or resistance or protests or whatnot) -- this
will probably be the most important use case for those hosting the network.
They need to communicate and make sure things are properly organized. If i
were in this situation, I would consider this the utmost importance as there
are very serious consequences (prison, death, etc) attached. This needs to
happen.

2a. Keeping the world informed -- protests and such are messy affairs. Its
usually best to be very public about all happenings, particularly when your
opponent is the government. Public and international, as you want things to
remain somewhat tame, and the easiest way to do this has historically have
""the whole world is watching"" situations (well better than the alternative
:( ).

2b. Keeping up on the rest of the word: Is the UN sending in blue helmets?
Will we get help coming in and when? Are we getting the right message out
about our goals?

3. Tell my family I am alive. People will want to share this info with
family and friends abroad.

So on top of these use cases we have some weird constraints here:

* Limited Internet connectivity. It's like the olden days but worse -- fast
LAN super slow WAN. Further that WAN link is probably pretty sketchy and
down and up a lot.

* Honest to goodness hop-count issues, and other weirdnesses from running
lots of traffic through small boxes.

* Trust issues like woah -- social trust issues between/about various
groups, mesh networks seem tailor made for MiTM situations, canonical naming
and other issues go out the window.

* Infrastructure setup issues -- even if we get a packet network up and
running on meshed devices, there needs to be a bunch of local services set
up to deal with the fact that 1. no one can reach standard infrastructure
reasonable (see the limited connectivity issues) and 2. many of the local
language services are probably run on servers that can no longer talk to the
network, and probably can't reasonably be expected to jump on the mesh.

Ok so there is a weird situation here! Honestly a huge chunk of it sounds
like a job for freenet -- otherwise we just end up cobbling something
together out of git, ssh, pgp. Other things to consider too tho:

* Batching communications for low priority transmission. Email can work this
way. Or we could do something a bit more sophisticated.

* Key parties: seriously, this network and situation almost demands giving
everyone a key and good key ring apps. Otherwise this whole thing is fairly
easily subvertable. Key signing should be trivial, as should web-of-trust
stuff. smart-phones can really help here, a nice android app devoted to key
exchanges really makes the whole thing reasonable.

* user education -- everything above needs to be teachable to the users in
some form, quickly and with minimal effort, because really, there are bigger
things afoot and the easier it is to get people ready to go, the better.

Things that sound like good ideas to consider, but probably are just easier
to solve socially:

* deciding what gets out over the uplink: really this will come down to the
uplink operator anyway, so there is no point trying to enforce it...

* factional disputes, trust of leaders, who gets the best info out: this
problem has existed far longer than the internet, the real problem is that
social upheaval is pretty much by definition messy, and as such there is no
fix by tech.

Thanks to Brian I have the reading group time on my calendar, so I'll
plan to talk more with you all there, but here are some initial
thoughts to some of the recent discussion.

First things first, in addition to the git repo, we have some online
docs that we'd like you to have access to, read, and eventually edit.
To give you group access to the wiki, please create an account on
http://plexus.chambana.net - It's the frontend for requesting an LDAP

These are not in any sort of priority order...
- *finish* a commotion image with the basic services running and
deploy a test bed mesh within the IMC. Thanks to Brian's work this is
almost done. The test bed will be our internal testing ground for
whatever needs tested: bandwidth tests, distributed services,
whatever. We also have access to outdoor hardware and could then
expand that test mesh into downtown Urbana.
- new WRT theme. write a new frontend theme (programmed in Lua/Luci
http://luci.subsignal.org/ ) and application hooks for openwrt,
customized for commotion firmware. This isn't a huge priority, but
ties into the next item.
- write a 1-2-3 setup Lua/Luci based init script that allows easy
setup. one of the big goals that we have is a GUI frontend for the
init scripts that Josh has worked on. This would need to be simple,
allow a series of choices for a person with no technical knowledge to
fill in some details (perhaps given to them by us or someone else
technical who is deploying a mesh) that configs their device to joint
the mesh, share bandwidth, etc.
- Some talk on the list about Batman, Batman Advanced, and OpenMesh.
These are great technologies and we could certainly use them. In fact,
OTi would like to roll all of them into commotion so that the user or
group deploying a mesh could choose which protocol they want to use.
The OpenMesh dashboard is nice, and Josh has planed to roll it into
the commotion firmware.
- Why not just go with OpenMesh? I dunno, you tell me. What I've been
told is that OLSR is simply a better routing protocol, just doesn't
have the non-techie frontend yet. We're on the bleeding edge here
folks, so any direction is fine. I could see us putting together a
small OpenMesh test bed and do comparison tests with the OLSR test
bed.
- Windows OLSR client. There are old binaries on the olsr site, so we
need to build an updated one from source. this involves installing
cygwin, bison, flex, and any other dependencies, building the source
and then putting together a gui wrapper for it. The build should be
straightforward. Putting a GUI together is another. This needs to be
done.

> Im aware that getting the commotion distro up and working is part of it. As

- Language support as a user preference would be great. It's supported
in OpenWRT I believe. Remember that config script idea? Language
option as a choice. There's also translation to think about for any
new interface pages we write.

That's enough for now. Hope to see you all Thursday evening.

40,Commotion-dev, Critical services,"Tue, 01 Feb 2011 08:48:52 -0600",-0600,Peter Folk,"I think that this type of project would have the most effect if it
included special-case optimizations for four critical services, in order
of importance:

   1. One-to-many updates (RSS including twitter and facebook; inbound)
   2. One-to-many updates (updating twitter, facebook, etc; outbound)
   3. Short one-to-one messages (IM, SMS)
   4. Medium-length one-to-one messages (email)

The first item could be implemented as follows:

*Caching Client-Server RSS Proxy* (CSSRSSP)
In net-accessible areas, servers run a daemon that accepts incoming SSH
connections (for compression as much as security), over which the
following protocol is run:

    * client sends monitor<space>N<cr><lf> (for int N) to indicate that
      it is monitoring N feeds.  N should be 10 digits, 0-padded on the
      left.
    * client sends N monitor notifications, consisting of
      A<space>B<space>C<space>D<cr><lf>, where A is the number of users
      monitoring the feed, B is the 64-bit UTC timestamp of the last
      update received for this feed, and C is the number of characters
      in the feed's URL, and D is that URL.  Numbers are 10, 20, and 5
      digits, respectively, 0-padded on the left, to make read() as easy
      as possible
    * server begins to monitor the feed urls, polling each feed (with
      higher frequency, down to the feeds minimum update time) in a
      round-robin fashion weighted by # of monitoring users
    * When a feed is updated, server sends A<space>B<space>C<cr><lf>,
      where A is the timestamp of the update (20 digits), B is 0 if this
      is the full feed, the length of the update (in bytes; 10 digits)
      otherwise, and C is the diff of the RSS feed from the timestamp
      last reported to be cached by this client
    * Client periodically updates server with new ""monitor N"" info.  A
      user count of 0 removes the feed from the client's list of
      monitored feeds.  Otherwise, an entry with an already-seen URL
      updates the timestamp and user count on record for that client
    * Server caches the most recent list of monitored feeds and metadata
      in a file, with name == MD5 checksum of the file
    * Client can resume a cached state (eg, after disconnection) by
      sending resume<space>A<cr><lf> with the A == the md5sum of a
      previous state, to which the server should reply either ok<cr><lf>
      if it has such a state or no<cr><lf> if it does not

On the client side, this general daemon can be used to implement a
caching twitter, facebook, and general RSS-feed proxy (each one would
require some custom code).


The second item could be implemented with custom code per updateable
service in the client-side interface to the proxy.  That might be
preferable to using standard HTTP interface because those short updates
could be prioritized above general HTTP traffic.


The third item is only hard if you actually need to proxy the sessions
to disallow or reprioritize file transfers (which should go via the same
priority as HTTP, for example).  That amount of prioritization might
come for free with classification by port with per-stream bandwidth
throttling.


The 4th item is basically a normal SMTP-hijacking mail server that is
configured to be pretty much an open relay, and deal well with being
disconnected (maybe have some batch-transfer mechanism like UUCP). 
Extra points for cacheing the login credentials and original target of
an SMTP request, so you can forward a message to its intended
destination and avoid relaying issues...

Some thoughts,
Peter

Notes:

    * the client and server's caches of monitored URLs need to be sorted
      the same to get the same MD5sum.  I suggest sort by URL.
    * in the ""When a feed is updated"" step, you need to have a boolean B
      (0 if this is the full feed, 1 if sending a diff update), and a
      separate B1 for the length of the update in bytes (left-padded 10
      digit decimal)
    * padding could be zeros or spaces; zeros would normally indicate
      octal so maybe spaces are better
    * Probably need a ""nok"" response if a line was received that the
      server doesn't grok
    * Probably need an intro ""ccsrss v1.2 foo at bar.com"" message from the
      server to announce the server version and who to contact if it's
      broken
    * My acronym was wrong =P  Should be CCSRSSP (which to me means, it
      needs a new name)
    * I think that such a client+server could be written in an evening
      in perl (and probably Python, for someone who likes it)
    * this kind of proxy would be useful for any system that's
      periodically connected, wants to monitor multiple RSS feeds, and
      usually has a slow link (like a cell phone).

It seems to me likely that a person will usually know the person
providing their gateway (multiple small disconnected cells are more
likely than a full mesh) or at least someone who knows that person (no
need for a party, which is operationally dangerous; you can have a chain
of trust).

With that in mind, you need each user to exchange a key with their
gateway host, in the form of the fingerprint for a self-signed SSL cert,
and get the direct URL of that gateway so that it can (via whatever
routing mechanism) use a secure HTTP proxy and critical service
interfaces that run on the gateway.

The gateway owner needs to get fingerprints of trusted out-of-country
proxies, ccsrssp hosts, etc.  Since the gateway operator has 'net
access, that can be PKI-based.

Yes, but reasonable defaults will make things work better:

    * On the gateway, identify uplink bandwidth with periodic
      observations and/or speed tests
    * Prioritize critical-service traffic, DNS, and known chat
      protocols, over bulk traffic
    * If the gateway only communicates with an out-of-country proxy
      (through an SSH tunnel, for example), that proxy can similarly
      prioritize gateway-bound traffic

To toss out this idea for priorities...

1) Get standard oslr mesh and tor running on the firmware.
2) Get default mesh params so that these devices are turned on and ready to go.
3) Get dashboard interface working that shows you the status of the
devices (how many mesh nodes are connected? Do I have an uplink?)
4) Get easily-reconfigured mesh param interface up.
5) Get custom caching services up.
6) Get some security (certificates perhaps) for mesh nodes and work
that into the interface for approval.

My guess is that the uplink from the gateway will be one of the most
stable components of this whole system; just very slow.  That said the
proxy I described is designed to help with flaky uplinks.

RE storage caching, it seems to me that even with relatively old
hardware you can cache a lot: 10M would hold 10k compressed smtp
messages or a similar number of RSS feeds.  I'm not talking about
caching video, or even images, for the critical services.  That might be
a reason to have the critical services proxy run on some gateways and
the general http proxy run on others (so that it can use the max
resources for caching).

week. That goes at 7:00pm on Thursday nights.

Most of the people in the reading group are new to mesh, olsrd, and
OpenWrt, but they are dedicated and passionate individuals. I've asked
if they would be interested in helping with this project.

It would be great if other folks in the Chambana area could drop by. We
could meet each other in person and have a chance to discuss the project
and engage the other members of the reading group.

So if you're in Chambana and you're free at 7 this Thursday, stop by 202
S Broadway in Urbana (old Post Office), next to Lincoln Square Mall.
Head downstairs to the Makerspace.

Thanks!
Brian

some cheap routers even come with an usb port. (also, one might
manually solder an sd-card to the gpio pins to get storage beyong a
few megs to many without usb port)
lately i saw lots of those portable 3g routers, they come with small
battery pack and got ethernet, usb and wifi and are intended to be
used with 3g usb dongles -- but u could just plug a usb pen drive and
have the ideal building block for an emergency caching network... i
guess the best part is that they can survive power outages for at
least 1 or 2 hours...
all the ones i saw are based on ralink rt3052f, and coincidently,
ramips usb support was added to openwrt trunk today.

We have a new development site up for the Commotion firmware, you can
access it at http://tech.chambana.net/projects/commotion

When you register, there's space for wikis, documents, tickets, forums,
etc (it is a redmine installation, so all of the features you would
expect from that). You can also upload your ssh keys which will give you
access to the commotion repo. To check out commotion for read-only
access, do the following:

git clone http://git.chambana.net/commotion.git

Once you're registered on the site and have committer access, you can
access the source tree via:

git clone git at git.chambana.net:commotion.git

I'm working on adding in milestones, tickets, documentation, build
instructions, etc. Please let me or the list know if you have any
questions. Thanks, and happy hacking!

Not sure where this would fit in the roadmap so I didn't attempt to 
update anything on the website.

Couple thoughts:


- There's mention of GSM and LPFM on the frontpage as backbone / links 
to the rest of the Internet. Since I've been working over the past few 
days on modem access (including ""modem callback"") it would be 
interesting to envision (landline) modem access as a third [...] option.

Refs on this topic (I haven't been involved directly with these folks, 
I'm working this as an FDN project):

http://blog.fdn.fr/post/2011/01/28/Censure-de-l-internet-en-%C3%89gypte-%3A-une-humble-action-de-FDN


- I think I had mentioned villagetelco[1] to Dan & Peter. The folks at 
villagetelco have produced a nice piece of _open_ hardware[2] with WAN, 
LAN, FXS port, low power, rugged...

Note: To connect to a residential line for modem access an FXO port 
would be needed instead of an FXS port. But the changes for that 
shouldn't be extremely extensive.

- An uplink doesn't have to be IP -- UUCP or BBS-type connections might 
be better suited to ""most of the time offline"" uplinks. (I don't have 
much insight here, though.)


That's it for now.

Great news!

I would recommend checking out some of the recent threads on the olsr-users
listserv re: options for encryption in an ad-hoc mesh, since they are
limited, and/or present paths of diminishing returns.

That is, although schemes like WPA-NONE have been mentioned, the general
problem is that the volume of packets moving over modem meshes quickly
reduce the time needed for an interloper to snoop packets and crack the key.

Other suggested options include layer-2 encryption, although I'm uncertain
to what extent the current OpenWRT/Atheros platform may support this, or
using tools like tinc to simply forward VPN tunnels thru the mesh.

Nice. That's useful.

Will this be an open process? I understand some boot strapping usually 
needs to happen behind closed doors, such that an initial proposal can 
be floated out to the wider community. Just curious as to the nature of 
the process.

Nice!! I live in Austin TX, and am very close to the local hacker space. 
I run a small mesh network (4 nodes) and have been involved with the 
VillageTelco project for some time. So I'm well versed in mesh network 
deployment/optimization etc. I'm happy to test out firmware images, 
tweaks, hacks etc. My last engagement was building a mesh network to 
support voip applications. It was challenging but a lot of fun. We made 
it work.

Ben, I have the feeling you are mixing different types of ""encryption""  in the sentence above and then you say it is ""limited"". I don't quite agree. See below for what I mean :)

with WEP, yes. But not so much with WPA2.

The main problem with ad-hoc mode is that there is no good WPA2 support for it (i.e. no good layer 2 security in ad-hoc mode).
Please note, that however is a shortcoming of the wireless drivers (layer 2) and not of OLSR (which is on layer 3).

I have to say I'm skeptical about whether it's possible to secure the
routing layer against malicious insiders in a mesh scenario.

The fundamental problem is that in the absence of a trusted identity
infrastructure, such as a centralised PKI, there's nothing to stop an
attacker from using an arbitrary number of identities (at layer 2, layer
3, or both), which makes it very hard to do things like rate-limiting,
fault detection, etc. And I agree that a centralised PKI isn't suitable
for a mesh scenario.

In the past I've run some simulations of DoS attacks against ad hoc
routing protocols by malicious insiders. I didn't look at OLSR, but the
results for on-demand protocols like AODV are extremely bad: a single
attacker can disable a network of a thousand nodes just by flooding the
network with route requests. Clearly that specific attack wouldn't apply
to OLSR, but I'm pretty confident that a malicious insider who can
change identities at will can mess with the protocol in some way.

While end-to-end encryption at a higher layer is certainly a good idea,
it won't protect against attacks that prevent data from getting through.
So I guess there are two possible approaches to this problem.

The first approach would be to try to fix the problem, which could mean
spending years developing a routing protocol that's robust to malicious
insiders in the absence of a trusted identity infrastructure. (Maybe a
solution already exists - but I spent a while researching this topic and
never found one.)

The second approach would be to note that there may be a vulnerability
in the design and carry on.

Personally I think the second approach is better, because a network that
doesn't resist this particular class of attacks is still way more
valuable than a pile of research papers and no network. But maybe I'm
over-compensating for spending too much time on research in the last few
years and not enough time on implementation. :-)

Cheers,
Michael

Unfortunately, without some control over the creation of identities,
voting doesn't help - the attacker can just create an arbitrary number
of identities that out-vote the non-corrupt nodes (the Sybil attack).

;-) I'm not sure that signatures provide much benefit without an
identity infrastructure. Yes, they prevent forgery, but ""This message
was signed by Bob"" doesn't mean much if you don't know who Bob is... or
if Bob might be the same person as Alice, etc.

Wow, I hadn't even thought about attacks against the physical layer! But
jamming a large mesh would require a lot of resources, as you say,
whereas by attacking the routing protocol you could potentially disable
the whole mesh from a single point.

Good point, security isn't all-or-nothing. These defences are definitely
worth considering, but I suspect that (b) will be vulnerable to an
attacker who can maintain multiple identities (Sybil attack) and (e)
will be vulnerable to an attacker who can change identities at will
(whitewashing). Still, implementing such defences would at least force
the attacker to be more sophisticated.

Likewise! Sorry I don't have something more positive to offer. ;-)

On a more serious note, I am curious if folks on the list have experience
using tinc for secure tunnels thru production meshes (= being used by folks
not on a OLSR/OpenWRT/Commotion/etc listserv ;).  I understand the routing
plane will continue to be vulnerable to outages brought on by brute force
DOS of some variety.

Ben, as you know at least some of the people here actually have production meshes!
Strange, I thought you were at the wireless summit and thus knew that actually our networks are production.

Anyway, to answer your question: yes, tinc was used for some time in some of the Freifunk networks in Germany. I don't know if they still use it and if not why they stopped.

I would recommend checking out some of the recent threads on the olsr-users

That is, although schemes like WPA-NONE have been mentioned, the general

reduce the time needed for an interloper to snoop packets and crack the key.

Other suggested options include layer-2 encryption, although I'm uncertain

using tools like tinc to simply forward VPN tunnels thru the mesh.

Will this be an open process? I understand some boot strapping usually

be floated out to the wider community. Just curious as to the nature of

Nice!! I live in Austin TX, and am very close to the local hacker space. 
I run a small mesh network (4 nodes) and have been involved with the 
VillageTelco project for some time. So I'm well versed in mesh network 
deployment/optimization etc. I'm happy to test out firmware images, 
tweaks, hacks etc. My last engagement was building a mesh network to 
support voip applications. It was challenging but a lot of fun. We made 
it work.

The main problem with ad-hoc mode is that there is no good WPA2 support for it (i.e. no good layer 2 security in ad-hoc mode).
Please note, that however is a shortcoming of the wireless drivers (layer 2) and not of OLSR (which is on layer 3). 

It would be *great* if the commotion project could make WPA2 work in ad-hoc but even if it can not, we still
have a) a way to secure routing messages (i.e. protect the routing layer against malicious insiders) by signing the routing messages [1] 
or b) we can use Tor , OpenVPN, IPSec,...or any other end-to-end encryption scheme to protect the data layer.


So, I see no problem with that. We can do that. We can build that. We don't need to rely on layer 2 WPA2 in ad-hoc mode.
Sure, any encryption will cost CPU power. But that is a trade off that you might want to make when you want to send data securely.

attacker from using an arbitrary number of identities (at layer 2, layer

While end-to-end encryption at a higher layer is certainly a good idea,
it won't protect against attacks that prevent data from getting through.
So I guess there are two possible approaches to this problem.

The first approach would be to try to fix the problem, which could mean
spending years developing a routing protocol that's robust to malicious
insiders in the absence of a trusted identity infrastructure. (Maybe a
solution already exists - but I spent a while researching this topic and
never found one.)

The second approach would be to note that there may be a vulnerability
in the design and carry on.

Personally I think the second approach is better, because a network that
doesn't resist this particular class of attacks is still way more
valuable than a pile of research papers and no network. But maybe I'm
over-compensating for spending too much time on research in the last few
years and not enough time on implementation. :-)

Cheers,
Michael

Unfortunately, without some control over the creation of identities,
voting doesn't help - the attacker can just create an arbitrary number
of identities that out-vote the non-corrupt nodes (the Sybil attack).

;-) I'm not sure that signatures provide much benefit without an
identity infrastructure. Yes, they prevent forgery, but ""This message
was signed by Bob"" doesn't mean much if you don't know who Bob is... or
if Bob might be the same person as Alice, etc.

Wow, I hadn't even thought about attacks against the physical layer! But
jamming a large mesh would require a lot of resources, as you say,
whereas by attacking the routing protocol you could potentially disable
the whole mesh from a single point.

Good point, security isn't all-or-nothing. These defences are definitely
worth considering, but I suspect that (b) will be vulnerable to an
attacker who can maintain multiple identities (Sybil attack) and (e)
will be vulnerable to an attacker who can change identities at will
(whitewashing). Still, implementing such defences would at least force
the attacker to be more sophisticated.

> Thanks for your inspiring mail!

Likewise! Sorry I don't have something more positive to offer. ;-)

Michael

Besides the microwave oven augmented with an aerial, XKCD also points out
this fundamental flaw in any security scheme requiring human memory:
http://xkcd.com/538/

On a more serious note, I am curious if folks on the list have experience
using tinc for secure tunnels thru production meshes (= being used by folks
not on a OLSR/OpenWRT/Commotion/etc listserv ;).  I understand the routing
plane will continue to be vulnerable to outages brought on by brute force
DOS of some variety.

Curious as to what your response means? Do you have a system with lower

Ben, as you know at least some of the people here actually have production meshes!
Strange, I thought you were at the wireless summit and thus knew that actually our networks are production.

Anyway, to answer your question: yes, tinc was used for some time in some of the Freifunk networks in Germany. I don't know if they still use it and if not why they stopped.

My apologies for the disparaging remark about production meshes.  Yes, I see
that the IS4CWN conference, this listserv (among others) means people are
actually using such networks for broadband access.

Also, yes, I did manage to get WPA-NONE working myself in IBSS mode under
OpenWRT + ath9k, although unfortunately not with 802.11n HT modes.  I
remember some confusion both on olsr-users listserv and OpenWRT forums about
whether WPA-NONE did actually work.

108,Commotion-dev, commotion news,"Fri, 01 Jul 2011 15:53:09 -0400",-0400,Josh King,"Hey all,

I just wanted to update you on some of the things that have been going
on in Commotion-land, and get some discussion and development going
again on this list after a bit of an absence. Entirely my fault, I've
been travelling for work over much of the past month, and when not doing
that, things have been pretty crazy (as you may have seen in the media ;-)).

* We had a very successful codesprint at the beginning of June to more
officially kick-off the project, and had developers from a number of
different projects around the globe in attendence, including Guardian
Project, Funkfeuer, OpenBTS, Serval, several community networks, and
more (you can see the complete list on the project site). Myself and
Preston at OTI are still working on turning all of the notes from that
into wiki pages and milestones; let me know if you want to lend a hand.
Among other things, codesprinters managed to make what we think is the
first ever OpenBTS to Serval phonecall over mesh wireless!

* You may have seen all of the press fallout from the New York Times
article; we knew that the Times was publishing an article, but not when
or what it would say exactly. The whole idea of an Internet in a
Suitcase (a total misnomer) seems to have caught on, with everyone from
Al-Jazeera to BBC to NBC and more being interested. This has also
created waves of misinformation about the project which I've been doing
my best to dispell; it's not a black-ops project by secret government
agents creating surveillance hardware, it's an open-source software
integration effort to create a platform for free speech and
communication on the Internet.

* Incidentally, I did register commotionwireless.net, .org, and .com, as
well as internetinasuitcase.net and .org (someone else picked up .com).
I'll be pointing those domains at the project site for now.

* A team from OTI in cooperation with the Detroit Digital Justice
Coalition and Allied Media Projects deployed a test network running the
Commotion firmware in Detroit during the Allied Media Conference. It's
pretty barebones but functional and sharing Internet through part of the
Cass Corridor neighborhood.

* Finally, the new Iranian Minister of Intelligence has apparently
predicted the Commotion project and ""devised proper ways to combat
them."" I hope you find this as interesting and worrying and oddly
hilarious as I do ;-)

I'm continuing to touch base with people individually as we work on
documentation, and I'm planning on sending out a doodle to schedule a
skype call sometime with in the next week or so soon to discuss progress
and next steps. Please let me know if anyone is having any trouble
accessing the project site, or if you have any questions. For the people
in Champaign-Urbana, IL US, I will be out there in the middle of July
partly to do some server and wireless work so hopefully we can meet up!

I just finally got a working instance of OpenWRT r26910 on the Buffalo
NFiniti, including the 802.11n radio.

Do note that Daniel is referring to the ""trunk"" branch of OpenWRT and not
the ""backfire"" branch.  The latter branch is apparently still missing
support for the newer g301nh chipset.

In particular, this is what I did to checkout / compile the revision of
OpenWRT mentioned, with luci and some other stuff enabled.

I'm also attaching my config for make menuconfig. (I.e unzip this file and
name it .config in the root of the OpenWRT repo, before running make world.)

svn co -r 26910 svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/trunk/ ./trunk-r29610
cd trunk-r29610
cp feeds.conf.default feeds.conf
./scripts/feeds update -a
./scripts/feeds install -a -p luci
./scripts/feeds install -a -p luci-ssl
./scripts/feeds install bmon
#copy in .config file
make world V=99
#wait for several hours

I used the tftp method described in the wiki to flash the router. You may
have luck using the upgrade page provided with the stock DD-WRT firmware.

Finally, do note this version of OpenWRT appears to have everything at /
mounted read-only.  The writeable overlay is located at /overlay,
specifically at /overlay/etc.  If you have to copy a file from /etc over to
/overlay/etc, e.g. opkg.conf, you may need to have to reboot to get the
writeable file recognized.

If you log-in to the router and manually run udhcpc on that port with a longer timeout (currently 3 tries/5 seconds, I believe), does it then get a lease? I'm not experienced with that particular modem, but I have had issues with DHCP leases on OpenWRT with other, similar hardware.

Has anyone else had similar difficulties using their NFiniti with a wired broadband connection that issues DHCP leases?  I don't have this problem with the Mikrotik rb532a boards running Backfire rc4, when connected to a Charter cable modem.

Is this also a problem when you reboot the buffalo or have you only
tried plugging the network cable while the router is already on? We
could debug it with tcpdump.

Yes, I did learn (the hard way, naturally) that the cable modem wants to be

119,Commotion-dev, Draft Roadmap,"Wed, 27 Jul 2011 09:07:48 -0400",-0400,Josh King,"Hey everyone,

I have published a draft roadmap for the project at:

http://tech.chambana.net/projects/commotion/wiki/roadmap

This is rough so far (and software focused, still working on adding in
more documentation and outreach tasks), but I think serves to give an
overall view of how the project is laid out and where it's heading.
Recognizing that the project is made up of a large number of different
pieces on different platforms, I've made a few structural decisions as
far as the roadmap (and a coincident refactoring of the website):

* The project has been re-structured into a number of subprojects, as it
didn't make sense to me to put a large number of projects with
substantially different codebases into one git repository. I realize
that if we end up having a large shared codebase at the end then we may
want to re-integrate, or create a shared repository drawn on by all
sub-projects. Other people may have other takes on this. In any event,
there are subprojects ""Commotion-Openwrt"", ""Commotion-Android"",
""Commotion-Windows"", etc. I hope that this will also help to clarify
confusion between Commotion the overarching project and Commotion the
OpenWRT embedded firmware (now Commotion-OpenWRT). All issues from
subprojects are visible in the existing ""Commotion"" superproject.

* The roadmap is structured into a number of 'releases.' The first one
is a pre-release at the end of October, which will serve simply to pull
together all of the disparate software elements in their current form,
as well as give me some time to work on some features for the
Commotion-OpenWRT firmware to bring it up to feature parity with some
other firmwares out there in order to make it more useful to the
community networks we're working with to deploy and test it. Past that,
there are 4 ""Developer Releases"" which are split up in roughly 2-month
increments through the year, with a ""Finished Release"" next summer. I
structure it in this way to recognize that we need some general
milestones to hit, but that each piece of component software has its own
versioning and there's no need to try and change that, and the DR1-4
naming scheme is not likely to strongly conflict with any other
versioning scheme in use. Feedback around this is welcome, and the
timeline is likely to change slightly as the release date as required by
OTI's Internet Freedom grant award is predicated on when we actually get
the check from the US State Department, which is not yet.

I'm currently still putting items from the roadmap into the issue
tracker as it makes sense, and adding users from the existing project
into the subprojects (Redmine doesn't automatically migrate them).
People should feel free to add to the roadmap for now, just ping the
list when you do so to help me keep track of what's changed.

Why don't you guys just work with the villagetelco project? The SCEN
firmware. They are light years
ahead of everyone else in mesh. They have numerous production
deployments. I think it's better to
utilize the VT SCEN firmware and modify to suit, as opposed to starting
from scratch.

This is the approach being taken by the Free Network Foundation (of
which I'm a founder). We are moving
very close to shipping FreedomNode, which is a combination of the ideals
of FreedomBox/Byzantium/Commotion.

We are hoping to have our full reference implementation completed this
weekend and shipping a completed package
by end of August.

Everyone else seems light years away from shipping. *shrugs* We will all
see who delivers first I guess. :)

Its good to see a overview of the time and the chunks.  I just noticed  
that you have listed ""native mesh network configuration GUI"" for  
Windows and Mac.  That sounds like the best plan in the long run, but  
perhaps it makes sense to have a cross-platform Java or something GUI  
to get the ball rolling.  I'm not sure yet which approach is best in  
the time frame.  Writing native apps for each platform will be more  
work, but I'm a big believer in having things feel seamlessly  
integrated, and often native apps are the most effective approach.

I agree it makes sense to split up into multiple git repos.  The most  
useful rule of thumb I've seen for where to make the dividing lines is  
thinking about it in terms build automation: any commit to a repo will  
trigger a build, is that build going to be relevant to the commit?   
One example we have is an app suite for J2ME, Blackberry and Android.   
All Java, all the same goals and features, currently all on git.  The  
J2ME and Blackberry code ends up being very much interwoven, while the  
Android code ended up being unrelated.  The next step might be to  
split out the common Java code into a library, then make separate git  
repos for J2ME, Blackberry, and Android.

The Android OS is also a good example, it is made up of many many git  
repos. That reminds me of another rule of thumb for where to set the  
dividing lines for git repos:  ideally, it should be possible to have  
the git commit messages make sense without having to add the context  
to the message itself.

126,Commotion-dev, commotion news,"Fri, 01 Jul 2011 15:53:09 -0400",-0400,Josh King,"Hey all,

I just wanted to update you on some of the things that have been going
on in Commotion-land, and get some discussion and development going
again on this list after a bit of an absence. Entirely my fault, I've
been travelling for work over much of the past month, and when not doing
that, things have been pretty crazy (as you may have seen in the media ;-)).

* We had a very successful codesprint at the beginning of June to more
officially kick-off the project, and had developers from a number of
different projects around the globe in attendence, including Guardian
Project, Funkfeuer, OpenBTS, Serval, several community networks, and
more (you can see the complete list on the project site). Myself and
Preston at OTI are still working on turning all of the notes from that
into wiki pages and milestones; let me know if you want to lend a hand.
Among other things, codesprinters managed to make what we think is the
first ever OpenBTS to Serval phonecall over mesh wireless!

* You may have seen all of the press fallout from the New York Times
article; we knew that the Times was publishing an article, but not when
or what it would say exactly. The whole idea of an Internet in a
Suitcase (a total misnomer) seems to have caught on, with everyone from
Al-Jazeera to BBC to NBC and more being interested. This has also
created waves of misinformation about the project which I've been doing
my best to dispell; it's not a black-ops project by secret government
agents creating surveillance hardware, it's an open-source software
integration effort to create a platform for free speech and
communication on the Internet.

* Incidentally, I did register commotionwireless.net, .org, and .com, as
well as internetinasuitcase.net and .org (someone else picked up .com).
I'll be pointing those domains at the project site for now.

* A team from OTI in cooperation with the Detroit Digital Justice
Coalition and Allied Media Projects deployed a test network running the
Commotion firmware in Detroit during the Allied Media Conference. It's
pretty barebones but functional and sharing Internet through part of the
Cass Corridor neighborhood.

* Finally, the new Iranian Minister of Intelligence has apparently
predicted the Commotion project and ""devised proper ways to combat
them."" I hope you find this as interesting and worrying and oddly
hilarious as I do ;-)

I'm continuing to touch base with people individually as we work on
documentation, and I'm planning on sending out a doodle to schedule a
skype call sometime with in the next week or so soon to discuss progress
and next steps. Please let me know if anyone is having any trouble
accessing the project site, or if you have any questions. For the people
in Champaign-Urbana, IL US, I will be out there in the middle of July
partly to do some server and wireless work so hopefully we can meet up!

the ""backfire"" branch.  The latter branch is apparently still missing
support for the newer g301nh chipset.

In particular, this is what I did to checkout / compile the revision of
OpenWRT mentioned, with luci and some other stuff enabled.

I'm also attaching my config for make menuconfig. (I.e unzip this file and
name it .config in the root of the OpenWRT repo, before running make world.)

svn co -r 26910 svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/trunk/ ./trunk-r29610
cd trunk-r29610
cp feeds.conf.default feeds.conf
./scripts/feeds update -a
./scripts/feeds install -a -p luci
./scripts/feeds install -a -p luci-ssl
./scripts/feeds install bmon
#copy in .config file
make world V=99
#wait for several hours

I used the tftp method described in the wiki to flash the router. You may
have luck using the upgrade page provided with the stock DD-WRT firmware.

Finally, do note this version of OpenWRT appears to have everything at /
mounted read-only.  The writeable overlay is located at /overlay,
specifically at /overlay/etc.  If you have to copy a file from /etc over to
/overlay/etc, e.g. opkg.conf, you may need to have to reboot to get the
writeable file recognized.

If you log-in to the router and manually run udhcpc on that port with a longer timeout (currently 3 tries/5 seconds, I believe), does it then get a lease? I'm not experienced with that particular modem, but I have had issues with DHCP leases on OpenWRT with other, similar hardware.

Is this also a problem when you reboot the buffalo or have you only
tried plugging the network cable while the router is already on? We
could debug it with tcpdump.

Yes, I did learn (the hard way, naturally) that the cable modem wants to be
power cycled when I plug a different box into it.  I will try the other

137,Commotion-dev, Draft Roadmap,"Wed, 27 Jul 2011 09:07:48 -0400",-0400,Josh King,"Hey everyone,

I have published a draft roadmap for the project at:

http://tech.chambana.net/projects/commotion/wiki/roadmap

This is rough so far (and software focused, still working on adding in
more documentation and outreach tasks), but I think serves to give an
overall view of how the project is laid out and where it's heading.
Recognizing that the project is made up of a large number of different
pieces on different platforms, I've made a few structural decisions as
far as the roadmap (and a coincident refactoring of the website):

* The project has been re-structured into a number of subprojects, as it
didn't make sense to me to put a large number of projects with
substantially different codebases into one git repository. I realize
that if we end up having a large shared codebase at the end then we may
want to re-integrate, or create a shared repository drawn on by all
sub-projects. Other people may have other takes on this. In any event,
there are subprojects ""Commotion-Openwrt"", ""Commotion-Android"",
""Commotion-Windows"", etc. I hope that this will also help to clarify
confusion between Commotion the overarching project and Commotion the
OpenWRT embedded firmware (now Commotion-OpenWRT). All issues from
subprojects are visible in the existing ""Commotion"" superproject.

* The roadmap is structured into a number of 'releases.' The first one
is a pre-release at the end of October, which will serve simply to pull
together all of the disparate software elements in their current form,
as well as give me some time to work on some features for the
Commotion-OpenWRT firmware to bring it up to feature parity with some
other firmwares out there in order to make it more useful to the
community networks we're working with to deploy and test it. Past that,
there are 4 ""Developer Releases"" which are split up in roughly 2-month
increments through the year, with a ""Finished Release"" next summer. I
structure it in this way to recognize that we need some general
milestones to hit, but that each piece of component software has its own
versioning and there's no need to try and change that, and the DR1-4
naming scheme is not likely to strongly conflict with any other
versioning scheme in use. Feedback around this is welcome, and the
timeline is likely to change slightly as the release date as required by
OTI's Internet Freedom grant award is predicated on when we actually get
the check from the US State Department, which is not yet.

I'm currently still putting items from the roadmap into the issue
tracker as it makes sense, and adding users from the existing project
into the subprojects (Redmine doesn't automatically migrate them).
People should feel free to add to the roadmap for now, just ping the
list when you do so to help me keep track of what's changed.

Why don't you guys just work with the villagetelco project? The SCEN
firmware. They are light years
ahead of everyone else in mesh. They have numerous production
deployments. I think it's better to
utilize the VT SCEN firmware and modify to suit, as opposed to starting
from scratch.

This is the approach being taken by the Free Network Foundation (of
which I'm a founder). We are moving
very close to shipping FreedomNode, which is a combination of the ideals
of FreedomBox/Byzantium/Commotion.

We are hoping to have our full reference implementation completed this
weekend and shipping a completed package
by end of August.

Everyone else seems light years away from shipping. *shrugs* We will all
see who delivers first I guess. :)

Its good to see a overview of the time and the chunks.  I just noticed  
that you have listed ""native mesh network configuration GUI"" for  
Windows and Mac.  That sounds like the best plan in the long run, but  
perhaps it makes sense to have a cross-platform Java or something GUI  
to get the ball rolling.  I'm not sure yet which approach is best in  
the time frame.  Writing native apps for each platform will be more  
work, but I'm a big believer in having things feel seamlessly  
integrated, and often native apps are the most effective approach.

I agree it makes sense to split up into multiple git repos.  The most  
useful rule of thumb I've seen for where to make the dividing lines is  
thinking about it in terms build automation: any commit to a repo will  
trigger a build, is that build going to be relevant to the commit?   
One example we have is an app suite for J2ME, Blackberry and Android.   
All Java, all the same goals and features, currently all on git.  The  
J2ME and Blackberry code ends up being very much interwoven, while the  
Android code ended up being unrelated.  The next step might be to  
split out the common Java code into a library, then make separate git  
repos for J2ME, Blackberry, and Android.

The Android OS is also a good example, it is made up of many many git  
repos. That reminds me of another rule of thumb for where to set the  
dividing lines for git repos:  ideally, it should be possible to have  
the git commit messages make sense without having to add the context  
to the message itself.

Hey Kusay,

The Commotion project is just getting rolling with a big development  
push over the next year or two.  You can see a rough roadmap here:

http://tech.chambana.net/projects/commotion/wiki/roadmap

I'm also just getting started in the project. There are many ways to  
contribute, from coding to testing to getting the word out to places  
like Syria or anywhere this can be useful.  Its up to what your  
interests, skills, and availability are.

    RIB: add prefix 101.162.75.0/24 from 5.20.162.75

strace[2] output does not show anything which looks to me like attempting
to add a route.

Otherwise the olsrds seem happy with each other -- the olsrd_dns plugin

Ben, would your proposal also leave a few nodes transmitting at full
power, or would everyone turn down their tx power? It seems like leaving
a few nodes at full power might help to keep the dense parts of the mesh
connected to each other as well as connected internally?

In a sense this is the ""O"" (optimzied) in OLSR (however, it only applies
to the signaling traffic).

This depends very much on the topological (and geographic) setting that you 
are in. If these higher power nodes can be heard by everyone (also the more
quiet nodes) then you will gain little. The goal is to reduce interference.

There is a reason that RF engineering is quite complicated ;-)

My best experience with RF engineering is ) to really know what antennas you are using (gain, opening angles) and 2) see if there is an overlap with other antennas/nodes and 3) use buildings (or trees) as a blocking material between different nodes . Then you can re-use the channels
4) use as low txpower as possible. The whole network improves if everybody is as quiet as possible.

But as I said - RF engineering is an art in it's own.

Hey Kusay,

Things are pretty raw right now, definitely in development.  So if you  
want to get involved now, you'll need to roll up your sleeves and get  
your hands dirty with the technical details. :)  A good place to start  
is to get a Buffalo router and try your hand at flashing it.  Then  
you'll have a node to start testing.  Other things to test now are  
OLSR wifi mesh routing.

But watch this list, we'll be posting more progress as we make it.

159,Commotion-dev, newbie question - routes not added,"Mon, 1 Aug 2011 16:57:25 -0400",-0400,Paul Bame,"I'm running commotion on a nanostation and compatibly hand-configuring a
debian laptop with olsrd etc.  Both boxes advertise HNA routes.  Neither
box actually inserts any routes into any route tables[1].  Debian box debug
shows it taking the code path which should probably insert the route:

    RIB: add prefix 101.162.75.0/24 from 5.20.162.75

strace[2] output does not show anything which looks to me like attempting
to add a route.

Otherwise the olsrds seem happy with each other -- the olsrd_dns plugin
is sharing data between boxes just fine.

The Debian testing box is Linux 2.6.380-2 with olsrd
0.6.1-2.  Nanostation is Linux 2.6.32.27 with olsrd
0.6.1-git_b9256ce-hash_bf1d618b6d6c23755adadfffcc41d59f with what may
be an older commotion build.

Can I buy a clue?  Thanks!

Ben, would your proposal also leave a few nodes transmitting at full
power, or would everyone turn down their tx power? It seems like leaving
a few nodes at full power might help to keep the dense parts of the mesh
connected to each other as well as connected internally?

In a sense this is the ""O"" (optimzied) in OLSR (however, it only applies
to the signaling traffic).

This depends very much on the topological (and geographic) setting that you 
are in. If these higher power nodes can be heard by everyone (also the more
quiet nodes) then you will gain little. The goal is to reduce interference.

There is a reason that RF engineering is quite complicated ;-)

My best experience with RF engineering is ) to really know what antennas you are using (gain, opening angles) and 2) see if there is an overlap with other antennas/nodes and 3) use buildings (or trees) as a blocking material between different nodes . Then you can re-use the channels
4) use as low txpower as possible. The whole network improves if everybody is as quiet as possible.

But as I said - RF engineering is an art in it's own.

Hey Kusay,

Things are pretty raw right now, definitely in development.  So if you  
want to get involved now, you'll need to roll up your sleeves and get  
your hands dirty with the technical details. :)  A good place to start  
is to get a Buffalo router and try your hand at flashing it.  Then  
you'll have a node to start testing.  Other things to test now are  
OLSR wifi mesh routing.

But watch this list, we'll be posting more progress as we make it.

We've come to the same conclusions, that trying to assume that a

a flawed model. It constrains the methods you can use to solve

205,Commotion-dev, Has anyone tried running Commotion with,"Tue, 03 Jan 2012 09:27:48 -0500",-0500,Josh King,"Hi Ben,

Actually most development on CommotionWRT has been done on quite the
opposite (devices w/ one radio, but multiple VAPs). There is some
configuration done w/ hardware interfaces, but those interface names are
retrieved as much as possible from the OpenWRT config files, and each
VAP when it's created has an actual interface name (like wlan0), so it's
all VAPs that it's operating on. I'm typing from my phone right now, but
as far as I recall boot-up order goes like this:

* OpenWRT by default starts without an /etc/config/wireless file. On
first boot, /etc/init.d/network checks for that file and if it doesn't
find it, detects the wireless cards and creates a default config (using
code in /lib/wifi/mac80211.sh), with the radios marked disabled. This is
hijacked by the /etc/init.d/meshconfig script, which runs first and does
the detection process to generate /etc/config/wireless. It then parses
/etc/config/network, and makes sure that for each network interface,
there's a VAP in /etc/config/wireless (it tries to distribute them
somewhat intelligently; if there are multiple physical radios, it puts
the ad-hoc mesh interface on the first one and then distributes the AP
interfaces across the other radios).

* Then the regular OpenWRT network initialization runs, which calls the
coldplug_* functions for each Commotion interface. These functions
configure the wireless VAPs created in the last step (setting SSIDs,
etc). The wireless is then brought up.

* Finally, the setup_interface_* functions are called, which configure
the IPs, firewall, etc for each interface. They also make a series of
hotplug calls, which run scripts in /etc/hotplug.d/ to configure various
services, like OLSRd.

There are definitely things that could be done better. For instance,
there are default interface names in /etc/config/network. This is done
to avoid complexity, as OpenWRT seems to assume that if you're building
a hardware-specific image you at least know what the hardware looks like
;-) However, this falls apart when building, say, an x86 iso. It's also
a bit of a problem in that it seems that most drivers want to have the
ad-hoc interface on the highest numbered interface (i.e., if you have an
AP on wlan0, and an ad-hoc on wlan1, and then you add another AP, the
ad-hoc becomes wlan2, and the second AP becomes wlan1, rather than just
incrementing interfaces like you'd expect). There's also the fact that
the whole IP address selection scheme from converting MAC addresses is
rather naive, and we should support several replacements as well.
Ideally, these would include hashing the MAC address to create the IP, a
la the IPv4LL or whatever it's called standard that gets you 169.254.*
addresses, along with the option of randomizing the MAC address, or
using just IPv6 addresses, or generating this all from a UUID that's
created at boot. I'm hoping to address all this for a forthcoming PR2.x
point release, but not all of it is solidified so patches, commits, and
suggestions welcome.

206,Commotion-dev, Has anyone tried running Commotion with,"Tue, 3 Jan 2012 17:04:16 -0600",-0600,Ben West,"Hi Josh,

Thanks for detailed response. I had posted the initial query specifically
about Commotion and multiple vAP's since I am looking for a platform to
migrate ~50 ath5k-based radios off of the current psuedo-stable ROBIN r3xxx
firmware.

Eliding over a long story: ROBIN works well present at present running OLSR
0.5.6-based  mesh on single-radio ath5k devices, but only on ath5k chipset
and with the madwifi driver packaged into OpenWRT Kamikaze.  It also has a
hard dependency on the ah-demo mode (as opposed to adhoc), and in
particular on running ah-demo + 2 other vAPs in managed mode.

There is an unstable version of ROBIN v2 based on Backfire (and thus with
ath9k support), but its developer community is tied up with other
priorities.

I'm presently looking at a couple options for migrating away from ROBIN
r3xxx:

1. Fix the broken stuff in ROBIN v2, so that it is suitable for production
use
2. Add ROBIN-like features to Commotion

Ideally, a combination of #1 and #2 would yield mutual benefits for both
user bases, especially since the current roadmap w/ ROBIN may end up
abandoning a large fraction of its user base.

The ""ROBIN-like"" features would be:

1. Centralized config mgmt via mesh dashboards like Cloudtrax, robin-dash,
wifi-mesh.
2. Related to #1, reporting of mesh health and live operational stats back
to dashboard (i.e. uptime, RSSI, # connected clients)
3. Support for CoovaChilli v1.2 captive portals
4. Auto-configuration of newly flashed nodes

ROBIN v2 does support all four, but it has stability problems with the
r28xxx generation Backfire it was last tested on in Sept. `11.

207,Commotion-dev, Commotion Messaging / Audit Survey,"Fri, 6 Jan 2012 12:43:03 -0500",-0500,Nina Bianchi,"Greetings!

We (the Work Department) are working on a range of Commotion project components and are kicking off the messaging development and design process.

We've created a short survey to audit and investigate the current messaging around Commotion with the goal of developing the most appropriate, sustainable and dynamic identity / branding.

Please take a little bit of time to fill this out by Wednesday, January 11, 5:00 PM EST. This is an essential step and we appreciate your time.

Hey Brian,

I briefly checked out your code, I'll dig in more soon.  Did you get ad-hoc mode running after all?  I assume so since you said you got olsrd running.  Apparently, on some devices, you have to replace the wpa_supplicant binary in order to get ad-hoc mode working:
http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=929865

Cyanogenmod seems to include everything needed to run ad-hoc though.

I just found this, which looks like it should provide us with some useful code:
http://code.google.com/p/adhoc-on-android/

On approach that might work for us is to include our own custom wpa_supplicant in the app.

Wow, that sounds quite elaborate, I'd like to see it in action :)  Can you point us towards the code that is doing all this?

My guess is that the level of detail will be needed to handle a lot of cases, but I think we have a good chance of simplifying things in the long run by including our own binaries in the app for things that are not kernel mods.

I'd love to find a way to include kernel mods that work across kernel versions, but I have not found a way to do that.  It must be possible, since people like nvidia are shipping binary kernel mods that work across a number of kernel versions.

A little bug report, in case you're interested:

I just downloaded Serval Mesh from the Marketplace on my Droid running CM7.1.  It gets thru ""Unpacking the stuff I need"", ""Checking for root access"", and ""I think I know how to control your wifi"", then says ""Skipped check for experimental support since we already support your handset."", and gets stuck on ""Test if WiFi control works"".  It just seems to try again and again.

219,Commotion-dev, Has anyone tried running Commotion with,"Tue, 03 Jan 2012 09:27:48 -0500",-0500,Josh King,"Hi Ben,

Actually most development on CommotionWRT has been done on quite the
opposite (devices w/ one radio, but multiple VAPs). There is some
configuration done w/ hardware interfaces, but those interface names are
retrieved as much as possible from the OpenWRT config files, and each
VAP when it's created has an actual interface name (like wlan0), so it's
all VAPs that it's operating on. I'm typing from my phone right now, but
as far as I recall boot-up order goes like this:

* OpenWRT by default starts without an /etc/config/wireless file. On
first boot, /etc/init.d/network checks for that file and if it doesn't
find it, detects the wireless cards and creates a default config (using
code in /lib/wifi/mac80211.sh), with the radios marked disabled. This is
hijacked by the /etc/init.d/meshconfig script, which runs first and does
the detection process to generate /etc/config/wireless. It then parses
/etc/config/network, and makes sure that for each network interface,
there's a VAP in /etc/config/wireless (it tries to distribute them
somewhat intelligently; if there are multiple physical radios, it puts
the ad-hoc mesh interface on the first one and then distributes the AP
interfaces across the other radios).

* Then the regular OpenWRT network initialization runs, which calls the
coldplug_* functions for each Commotion interface. These functions
configure the wireless VAPs created in the last step (setting SSIDs,
etc). The wireless is then brought up.

* Finally, the setup_interface_* functions are called, which configure
the IPs, firewall, etc for each interface. They also make a series of
hotplug calls, which run scripts in /etc/hotplug.d/ to configure various
services, like OLSRd.

There are definitely things that could be done better. For instance,
there are default interface names in /etc/config/network. This is done
to avoid complexity, as OpenWRT seems to assume that if you're building
a hardware-specific image you at least know what the hardware looks like
;-) However, this falls apart when building, say, an x86 iso. It's also
a bit of a problem in that it seems that most drivers want to have the
ad-hoc interface on the highest numbered interface (i.e., if you have an
AP on wlan0, and an ad-hoc on wlan1, and then you add another AP, the
ad-hoc becomes wlan2, and the second AP becomes wlan1, rather than just
incrementing interfaces like you'd expect). There's also the fact that
the whole IP address selection scheme from converting MAC addresses is
rather naive, and we should support several replacements as well.
Ideally, these would include hashing the MAC address to create the IP, a
la the IPv4LL or whatever it's called standard that gets you 169.254.*
addresses, along with the option of randomizing the MAC address, or
using just IPv6 addresses, or generating this all from a UUID that's
created at boot. I'm hoping to address all this for a forthcoming PR2.x
point release, but not all of it is solidified so patches, commits, and
suggestions welcome.

220,Commotion-dev, Has anyone tried running Commotion with,"Tue, 3 Jan 2012 17:04:16 -0600",-0600,Ben West,"Hi Josh,

Thanks for detailed response. I had posted the initial query specifically
about Commotion and multiple vAP's since I am looking for a platform to
migrate ~50 ath5k-based radios off of the current psuedo-stable ROBIN r3xxx
firmware.

Eliding over a long story: ROBIN works well present at present running OLSR
0.5.6-based  mesh on single-radio ath5k devices, but only on ath5k chipset
and with the madwifi driver packaged into OpenWRT Kamikaze.  It also has a
hard dependency on the ah-demo mode (as opposed to adhoc), and in
particular on running ah-demo + 2 other vAPs in managed mode.

There is an unstable version of ROBIN v2 based on Backfire (and thus with
ath9k support), but its developer community is tied up with other
priorities.

I'm presently looking at a couple options for migrating away from ROBIN
r3xxx:

1. Fix the broken stuff in ROBIN v2, so that it is suitable for production
use
2. Add ROBIN-like features to Commotion

Ideally, a combination of #1 and #2 would yield mutual benefits for both
user bases, especially since the current roadmap w/ ROBIN may end up
abandoning a large fraction of its user base.

The ""ROBIN-like"" features would be:

1. Centralized config mgmt via mesh dashboards like Cloudtrax, robin-dash,
wifi-mesh.
2. Related to #1, reporting of mesh health and live operational stats back
to dashboard (i.e. uptime, RSSI, # connected clients)
3. Support for CoovaChilli v1.2 captive portals
4. Auto-configuration of newly flashed nodes

ROBIN v2 does support all four, but it has stability problems with the
r28xxx generation Backfire it was last tested on in Sept. `11.

Hey Brian,

I briefly checked out your code, I'll dig in more soon.  Did you get ad-hoc mode running after all?  I assume so since you said you got olsrd running.  Apparently, on some devices, you have to replace the wpa_supplicant binary in order to get ad-hoc mode working:
http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=929865

Cyanogenmod seems to include everything needed to run ad-hoc though.

I just found this, which looks like it should provide us with some useful code:
http://code.google.com/p/adhoc-on-android/

On approach that might work for us is to include our own custom wpa_supplicant in the app.

Wow, that sounds quite elaborate, I'd like to see it in action :)  Can you point us towards the code that is doing all this?

My guess is that the level of detail will be needed to handle a lot of cases, but I think we have a good chance of simplifying things in the long run by including our own binaries in the app for things that are not kernel mods.

I'd love to find a way to include kernel mods that work across kernel versions, but I have not found a way to do that.  It must be possible, since people like nvidia are shipping binary kernel mods that work across a number of kernel versions.

A little bug report, in case you're interested:

I just downloaded Serval Mesh from the Marketplace on my Droid running CM7.1.  It gets thru ""Unpacking the stuff I need"", ""Checking for root access"", and ""I think I know how to control your wifi"", then says ""Skipped check for experimental support since we already support your handset."", and gets stuck on ""Test if WiFi control works"".  It just seems to try again and again.

No we don't write over any files in the system folder. At least not directly.
We'll probably end up trying to use our ""generic"" chipset profile

wifi_load_driver() / wifi_unload_driver().
CM7 seems to include this library, but using it might be the cause of

Samsung galaxy's work quite well, at least with the stock firmware.
I've also seen them work with CM, so I assume those roms have the same

If we can disable our ""generic"" profile for CM phones, we could work
towards supporting the built in modified wpa supplicant. We shouldn't
actually need to load the wifi driver ourselves since Cyanogen
supports joining adhoc networks anyway. Not sure if we can initiate a
network though.

I wonder if your phone is having trouble loading the (at a guess)
tiwlan_drv.ko module.

On stock Droids we do something like;
insmod /system/lib/modules/tiwlan_drv.ko
/system/bin/wlan_loader -f /system/etc/wifi/fw_wlan1271.bin -e
/proc/calibration -i [path]/tiwlan.ini
Then use ifconfig / iwconfig to get the network running

If you have firmware binaries in different places we wouldn't use this

Doh, oh well.  I see now: for serval, 'tether' was just renamed 'adhoc' and the ifconfig/ folder is stripped out.  I wonder if android-wifi-tether or OpenGarden would also nuke the wifi on my Droid-CM7.1, I'll try it out once I get it going again.  I had played with OpenGarden on that phone before, so I think not, but I'll try to confirm that.

So it looks like you split up the mega tether_edify script into per-device edify scripts.  That makes sense, it makes those scripts rational chunks.  Now I see the logging and all, but unfortunately, I already deleted batphone.  I reinstalled it and ran the setup again, the logs are attached.  I think it might be different than the initial attempt because detect.log is telling me this:

""Could not work out how to control your WiFi chipset. Relying on operating system, so no ad-hoc WiFi.""

Here's all the logs:

Yes, he does have some useful blog posts on his site, this will probably affect us to:

I have openwrt kamikaze 8.09.2 on four of the Fonera 2100s that I have, they work fine.

By the way, if anyone has some Foneras they want to get rid of, I'll take them.  I like to build out a decent sized test mesh to test how much roaming around with the phone will work.

debugging that would be necessary for this platform.

Hope this is helpful for someone.

Thanks for sharing!

I can confirm OpenWRT Kamikaze works fine on Fonera 2100 and other ath5k
units from using ROBIN mesh firmware (which is still based on Kamikaze).

I see you are telnetting in to 192.168.1.20, rather than the 192.168.1.1
that I was accustomed to for newly flashed OpenWRT backfire units.  Is this
is change that you applied yourself before compiling?

Also, would you be willing to share the kernel config you used to compile
these images?  It could possibly help diagnose problems encountered
flashing ath5k units with Backfire 10.03.1+

Sure thing. I'll see about locating the menuconfig from the build.

Regarding the IP, this is a change that was applied prior to compiling. I
believe it's part of the init scripts that are included when you build
OpenWRT with the Commotion RC2 feeds. I'm guessing the default IP comes
from the defaults for Ubiquity devices which are probably in the init
scripts.

I'll see about getting more details from my buildroot.

266,Commotion-dev, Poor routed throughput eth1 -> eth0 on Bufallo,"Fri, 17 Feb 2012 02:00:52 -0600",-0600,Ben West,"Hi All,

I happen to still be running the OpenWrt trunk 26908 build for the Buffalo
WZR-HP-G301NH units doled out at last year's Commotion code sprint, and I
believe I may have just determined this is showing pretty poor routed
throughput (~10 to 15mbits) from its WAN port eth1 to the LAN ports eth0.

This unit is presently working as a gateway router for a bunch of UBNT M5
mesh nodes, and I was having a persistent problem with the nodes topping
out at around 6Mbit download speeds from the Internet (speedtest.net),
until I tried downloading a file stored locally on the Bullafo flash and
got 20-30Mbits throughput.

dmesg confirms that eth1 is negotiating at 100Mbit on boot up, and I've
confirmed I don't have a mis-configured qos script interfering with things.
 Hopefully this is just because I'm running an old-ish OpenWRT trunk.  Has
anyone else been able to confirm Buffalo Nfiniti will actually sustain
20Mbit+ from its WAN port to LAN ports, provided the WAN uplink is fast
enough?

Thanks for the response.

I just got a couple more 300NH's in the mail, so I will be trying out
recent trunk (and also Backfire 10.03.1, if it works) on them soon.  Was
the 40Mbit/s speed achieved w/o using the qos script, or anything else that
clutters iptables like freifunk-p2pblock?  Likewise, were you using the
'option type bridge' setting on any interface?

Could you share your /etc/config/network?

can someone in here shed some light on the current state of adhoc-mode 
and olsrd/batmand on smartphones (for android-platform mostly I guess?).

1) On how many models is it known to work at all currently?
2) How much effort is it to make it work?
3) Are there ways to enable it WITHOUT breaking any other 
functionalities on the smartphone if installed?


paul






PS: the reason for asking is:

We thought that the upcoming loooong series of street protests (because 
of acta and it's yet unborn siblings) here in europe/anywhereelse 
provide a nice testbed situation:

During protest there are:
1) lots of technically inclined people with latest gen rooted/jailbroken 
smartphones in close physical proximity.
2) the prospect of helping to test if adhoc nets can spontaneously 
emerge will probably spark interest
3) protest events typically last for 2-4 hours each, thus energy 
efficiency problems (battery runtime) can be largely ignored at this stage
4) those protests all have a general ""we want to keep our networks out 
of central control"" subtext - perfect fit for the occasion.

We think that it does not really matter yet if these ""networks"" (they 
probably cannot stabilize anyhow, routingtable-wise) can be used for 
something useful at all - it is more about the fun of 
observing/participating. Just seeing some small partitioned network 
graphs as they spontaneously emerge/breakdown is enough. Form our point 
of view, it would certainly add some entertainment-bonus while we walk 
these long protest walks.

Currently, what we typically do while being there in the streets (appart 
from chanting and chatting with friends face2face) is using centralized 
twitter/facebook APIs on top of cellular networks controlled by large 
corporations. Although these tools are working fine and seem to be 
passing along messages unfiltered, there are many reasons to start 
questioning if this will stay like that.

CM7 seems to include this library, but using it might be the cause of

Samsung galaxy's work quite well, at least with the stock firmware.
I've also seen them work with CM, so I assume those roms have the same

If we can disable our ""generic"" profile for CM phones, we could work
towards supporting the built in modified wpa supplicant. We shouldn't
actually need to load the wifi driver ourselves since Cyanogen
supports joining adhoc networks anyway. Not sure if we can initiate a
network though.

I wonder if your phone is having trouble loading the (at a guess)
tiwlan_drv.ko module.

On stock Droids we do something like;
insmod /system/lib/modules/tiwlan_drv.ko
/system/bin/wlan_loader -f /system/etc/wifi/fw_wlan1271.bin -e
/proc/calibration -i [path]/tiwlan.ini
Then use ifconfig / iwconfig to get the network running

If you have firmware binaries in different places we wouldn't use this

I've tried now wiping the cache and doing a whole system update, and still no luck.  I haven't tried wiping the data yet.

- after a reboot, tiwlan0_drv is not loaded
- insmod /system/lib/modules/tiwlan_drv.ko works fine
- after insmod, ""Wireless & network settings"" says: Wi-Fi Error
- /system/bin/wlan_loader -f /system/etc/wifi/fw_wlan1271.bin -e /proc/calibration -i /system/etc/wifi/tiwlan.ini gives me:

If you want, I can hook this phone up to a computer where I can give you a shell, and you can hunt around. Its even got a Debian chroot on it, you can get a full Debian shell by running /data/local/bin/debian, thanks to LilDebi.apk.  :)

Doh, oh well.  I see now: for serval, 'tether' was just renamed 'adhoc' and the ifconfig/ folder is stripped out.  I wonder if android-wifi-tether or OpenGarden would also nuke the wifi on my Droid-CM7.1, I'll try it out once I get it going again.  I had played with OpenGarden on that phone before, so I think not, but I'll try to confirm that.

So it looks like you split up the mega tether_edify script into per-device edify scripts.  That makes sense, it makes those scripts rational chunks.  Now I see the logging and all, but unfortunately, I already deleted batphone.  I reinstalled it and ran the setup again, the logs are attached.  I think it might be different than the initial attempt because detect.log is telling me this:

""Could not work out how to control your WiFi chipset. Relying on operating system, so no ad-hoc WiFi.""

Yes, he does have some useful blog posts on his site, this will probably affect us to:

""...the wireless driver on many Android phones only beacons an ad-hoc network for a while, and then if no other client associates, it stops. The next time it tries, it uses a different BSSID.

If you try providing a BSSID in the settings, it might simply fail to beacon at all (it would only associate with an existing network matching that BSSID).""

I have openwrt kamikaze 8.09.2 on four of the Fonera 2100s that I have, they work fine.

By the way, if anyone has some Foneras they want to get rid of, I'll take them.  I like to build out a decent sized test mesh to test how much roaming around with the phone will work.

I've found that the Fon does take a while to autoconfig, and that they

debugging that would be necessary for this platform.

Hope this is helpful for someone.

Thanks for sharing!

I can confirm OpenWRT Kamikaze works fine on Fonera 2100 and other ath5k
units from using ROBIN mesh firmware (which is still based on Kamikaze).

I see you are telnetting in to 192.168.1.20, rather than the 192.168.1.1
that I was accustomed to for newly flashed OpenWRT backfire units.  Is this
is change that you applied yourself before compiling?

Also, would you be willing to share the kernel config you used to compile
these images?  It could possibly help diagnose problems encountered
flashing ath5k units with Backfire 10.03.1+

Sure thing. I'll see about locating the menuconfig from the build.

Regarding the IP, this is a change that was applied prior to compiling. I
believe it's part of the init scripts that are included when you build
OpenWRT with the Commotion RC2 feeds. I'm guessing the default IP comes
from the defaults for Ubiquity devices which are probably in the init
scripts.

I'll see about getting more details from my buildroot.

311,Commotion-dev, Poor routed throughput eth1 -> eth0 on Bufallo,"Fri, 17 Feb 2012 02:00:52 -0600",-0600,Ben West,"Hi All,

I happen to still be running the OpenWrt trunk 26908 build for the Buffalo
WZR-HP-G301NH units doled out at last year's Commotion code sprint, and I
believe I may have just determined this is showing pretty poor routed
throughput (~10 to 15mbits) from its WAN port eth1 to the LAN ports eth0.

This unit is presently working as a gateway router for a bunch of UBNT M5
mesh nodes, and I was having a persistent problem with the nodes topping
out at around 6Mbit download speeds from the Internet (speedtest.net),
until I tried downloading a file stored locally on the Bullafo flash and
got 20-30Mbits throughput.

dmesg confirms that eth1 is negotiating at 100Mbit on boot up, and I've
confirmed I don't have a mis-configured qos script interfering with things.
 Hopefully this is just because I'm running an old-ish OpenWRT trunk.  Has
anyone else been able to confirm Buffalo Nfiniti will actually sustain
20Mbit+ from its WAN port to LAN ports, provided the WAN uplink is fast
enough?

Thanks for the response.

I just got a couple more 300NH's in the mail, so I will be trying out
recent trunk (and also Backfire 10.03.1, if it works) on them soon.  Was
the 40Mbit/s speed achieved w/o using the qos script, or anything else that
clutters iptables like freifunk-p2pblock?  Likewise, were you using the
'option type bridge' setting on any interface?

Could you share your /etc/config/network?

Here is my /etc/config/network on the 301NH in question.  The uplink is a
20Mbit cable connection.

can someone in here shed some light on the current state of adhoc-mode

1) On how many models is it known to work at all currently?
2) How much effort is it to make it work?
3) Are there ways to enable it WITHOUT breaking any other 
functionalities on the smartphone if installed?


paul






PS: the reason for asking is:

We thought that the upcoming loooong series of street protests (because 
of acta and it's yet unborn siblings) here in europe/anywhereelse 
provide a nice testbed situation:

During protest there are:
1) lots of technically inclined people with latest gen rooted/jailbroken 
smartphones in close physical proximity.
2) the prospect of helping to test if adhoc nets can spontaneously 
emerge will probably spark interest
3) protest events typically last for 2-4 hours each, thus energy 
efficiency problems (battery runtime) can be largely ignored at this stage
4) those protests all have a general ""we want to keep our networks out 
of central control"" subtext - perfect fit for the occasion.

We think that it does not really matter yet if these ""networks"" (they 
probably cannot stabilize anyhow, routingtable-wise) can be used for 
something useful at all - it is more about the fun of 
observing/participating. Just seeing some small partitioned network 
graphs as they spontaneously emerge/breakdown is enough. Form our point 
of view, it would certainly add some entertainment-bonus while we walk 
these long protest walks.

Currently, what we typically do while being there in the streets (appart 
from chanting and chatting with friends face2face) is using centralized 
twitter/facebook APIs on top of cellular networks controlled by large 
corporations. Although these tools are working fine and seem to be 
passing along messages unfiltered, there are many reasons to start 
questioning if this will stay like that.

322,Commotion-dev, batphone/olsr GUI dev sync,"Mon, 12 Mar 2012 15:56:22 -0400",-0400,Hans-Christoph Steiner,"
Hey Jeremy and all,

I would like to try to keep the OLSR Android GUI app that I'm working on
as in sync as possible with batphone, since all of the adhoc/edify/olsrd
infrastructure will be exactly the same.  So far I've been working with
batphone 0.0.7, which seems to be the head of master in git.  But there
is a lot of work in the 'development' branch, some of which looks
related.  Does it make sense for me to switch over to syncing with your
development branch?

Also, some feedback on the command line stuff: currently, in the setup
wizard in 0.0.7 asks for root permission on each step.  I generally do
not grant apps permanent root perms, so that means I have to confirm
granting root perms on each step of the wizard, and probably each step
of the app running.  I propose that this app instead launch a root
shell, then execute commands as root by sending them to this shell.

This way, batphone will only ever ask once for root permission when it
needs it.  We've done this in Lil' Debi and some other apps and it works
well.

pretty much exactly like that in the development branch, though I'm
not keeping the shell open. These changes also make it easier to tell
the different between su permission errors and errors from executing
other commands, simplifying a fair amount of code and giving better
error messages.

We've had one phone that was impossible to root permanently, so the
software would always check for root permission when it was started.
But some other phones are very aggressive at killing background
processes (eg samsung's), which would cause the root test to pop up
quite frequently.

So we now run a foreground service when the software is ""on"" which
prevents us being killed, and we remember if we had root permission in
a setting that is only cleared on boot. As well as tweaking a couple
of other places where running commands as root could be avoided.

0.08 is feature complete, and we've pretty much run out of blocking
issues. So you can expect to see a release candidate build soon.

It should be possible to make a Remote Service that runs in the
background and is only killed as a last resort.  It has to be a Remote
Service, because that is the only way that I know to make the Service
run in its own process.  We use this in our Gibberbot app to maintain
the connections to the XMPP server even if the app is killed, and we
run it a lot on Samsungs.  I checked the AndroidManifest.xml and it
seems like there is no Remote Service, only standard Services.

Also, I just tried to build the head of 'development', and got the
errors below:

ndk-build:

Here's what I did before:

- android update project --path .
- set sdk.dir and env.NDK_ROOT in local.properties

I have a ""works for me"" olsrd app for Android now, I've called it OLSR-Mesh-Tether for now, since it was based on Barnacle Wifi Tether.  I'm waiting for commit access to the commotion git, then I'll post it there (unless there is another plan for how I should feed code into the commotion-android git).  If anyone wants to test it, I would love testers.

Here is the source and there is an apk in the Downloads:
https://github.com/guardianproject/olsr-mesh-tether

Currently the SSID is 'olsr.org' and its setup with the httpinfo plugin set to be world accessible.  If you click on the link in the little log window in the app, you'll bring up the httpinfo page.

Next up for me is making the Android app able to control olsrd parameters!

One question that I wanted to pose is: the document doesn't talk much

Just scanned through it, and it is promising. Regarding the DH verification, we have been working on this at Guardian within our Gibberbot secure chat app. We have recently.implement the Socialist Millionaire Protocol for OTR and it works great. In addition, we are looking at linking your OTR key as a subkey of an on-device GPG key, such that the chat based verification can extend to other types of keys and methods of communications. We would love to think about how this might support the verification process in a crypto mesh.

implementing anything yet. I have been doing some R&D on some new
ideas for link quality measurements, but we haven't really started
looking at the higher level routing problem yet.

An initial version might work in parallel to some other routing
daemon, eg olsr. The overlay layer would translate from public key to
current IP address, then consult the routing table to work out which
peer is the next hop. In this mode it should be possible for packets
to traverse an existing network without replacing the routing daemon
on every device.

There are some reasons why I don't like olsr / batman layer 3 routing.
The need to sense topology via broadcast packets, since the routing
table would prevent you sending test unicast packets to 2 hop
neighbours, this makes sensing link failures and new links take way
too long IMHO. You have much more flexibility operating at layer 2 or
4.

Eventually we intend to route across different networking protocols
and between networks that might be sharing the same IP addresses. eg
small networks of android phones in hotspot mode all with 192.168.43.X
addresses, with additional bluetooth links between them.

In my own research, with the android phones we have in reasonable
quantities, I've noticed that wifi burst mode consumes waaaaay too
much air time when a link suddenly fails. Though I haven't established
if this is systemic to wifi, or limited to this specific chipset. The
802.11 spec leaves dealing with burst failures up to the implementer.

Linux buffer bloat is also really annoying, it's far too easy to be
reacting to stale topology information.

Combine these two issues and building a map of a highly mobile network
is almost impossible with any reasonable traffic volume. Using BATMAN
for example, with mobile nodes, poor slightly directional antennas,
and obstructions, gives a voice channel that is almost continuously
dropping out.

Before diving into the Serval Overlay Mesh specifically, I'm curious about what the core motivations are for building a network with verifiable addresses.  If the client software can verify the identity over any network, like OpenPGP or OTR does, then it doesn't matter how the packets get there as long as they are properly encrypted and verified.  The internet is built upon those easily spoofed IP addresses, and it has proven a reliable medium for secure communications (given the right software on the endpoints).

I can understand wanting verified routing to prevent poisoning, but I guess this should be possible by adding crypto verification into the mesh daemons.  Something like: when olsrd receives a message to register a new route, that message includes a public key to tie to that route/address.  It seems feasible that this could happen purely within olsrd, batmand, etc.

Specifically about the Serval Overlay Mesh, sounds like a good plan if such a thing is needed. The huge problem with this approach is that is requires all of the software to be re-written to support it.  Another thing I wonder about is the architecture being built on a single cryptographic technique like Cryptobox.  It makes sense for the prototype to use only one type of key, but I think that the grand plan should allow for other types of keys, like OpenPGP does.

For the example of verified, encrypted voice calls, there is already ZRTP+SRTP+SIP.  We have a public alpha of a ZRTP-oriented voice service: https://ostel.me.  The ZRTP+SRTP+SIP combo is also fully compatible with a serverless, p2p setup.  You can use it with such clients as Jitsi (cross-platform), Twinkle (GNU/Linux), Groundwire (iOS), CSIPSimple (Android), and more.  More from us on that topic here:

340,Commotion-dev, OLSRD parameters & configuration on Android,"Fri, 6 Apr 2012 16:08:01 -0400",-0400,David Oliver,"We're commencing work on the user interface for Android olsrd.  Since oslrd
is a low-level utility, we need to use a certain amount of care in how much
of its function we expose to the end user (and, on Android devices, we're
going to be dealing with almost entirely ""end users"").

As we reviewed the parameter/configuration settings (which, in fact, are
the ""controls"" for olsrd), we realized that a number of the settings are
likely ""situation dependent"".  For example, one situation might be a mesh
network of mostly mobile phones connecting to a fixed-position WAP with a
route to the Internet.  Another situation might be a mesh of all mobile
phones with one of the mobile phones having a route to the Internet.

These differing situations will impact a number of olsrd parameters, almost
all of whic are going to be hard for end users to understand.  Therefore,
we'd like to remove such configuration from view and have users, instead,
focus on situations or ""usage scenarios"".  And therefore, we'd like to ask
this group to help us define common situations/scenarios.

I'll put up the following strawman as a way to get started.  To be clear,
while we're sure there are many more possible scenarios, we are focused on
scenarios involving olsrd as it is running on Android mobile phones and
tablets.

Scenarios:

1. A small group (< 25) of mobile phone or tablet users staying within
range of a fixed-point WAP connected to a fixed line route to the Internet.
 Group members may come and go as they please, but the size of the group
remains relatively constant.

2. A small group (< 25) of mobile phone users, one of which has a WWAN
route to the Internet. The group is moving in space constantly, but
generally stays close together. Group members may come and go as they
please, but the size of the group remains relatively constant.

3. A large group (> 100) of mobile phone users who are moving in space
amongst a set of fixed-point WAPs connected to a fixed line route to the
Internet.  New group members are constantly joining, while others are
leaving.

4. A large group (> 100) of mobile phone users who are moving in space with
a subset of these devices (<10) which have a WWAN route to the Internet.
 New group members are constantly joining, while others are leaving.

5. A large group (> 100) of mobile phone users who are moving in space with
all devices having a possible WWAN route to the Internet.  However, for
reason of specific conditions on the ground, it is beneficial for only a
small number of the users to use their WWAN connection at a given time
(rather, it is better to 'piggyback' traffic over a few such connections).
 It is also advantageous to the situation on the group to have those few
connections ""hop"" among the all group members randomly at relatively short
intervals (measured in minutes). New group members are constantly joining,
while others are leaving.

6. A mobile phone or tablet group of large size (unknown) utilize a
fixed-point WAP connected to a fixed line route to the Internet.  The group
is constantly changing, in size and membership, but the access point is
safe and durable.

(WWAN = wireless wide area network)

341,Commotion-dev, Serval security summary,"Wed, 11 Apr 2012 17:53:15 +0100",+0100,Michael Rogers,"Hi Josh,

Thanks for sharing this document. If I've understood the verification
process correctly, it's missing an important step when compared with
ZRTP. As I understand it, Serval does this:

* Each party generates a long-term public/private key pair
* Each party derives a shared secret from her own private key and the
other party's public key
* Each party derives some confirmation words from the shared secret
* The parties verbally compare their confirmation words

In contrast, ZRTP does this:

* Each party generates an ephemeral public/private key pair
* The parties first exchange the hashes of their public keys
* Then they exchange their public keys
* Each party derives a shared secret from her own private key and the
other party's public key
* Each party derives some confirmation words from the shared secret
* The parties verbally compare their confirmation words

Consider a man-in-the-middle attack against these two approaches. ZRTP
only gives the attacker a single attempt to choose key pairs that will
produce the right confirmation words. The attacker has to commit to the
hash of the public key she'll send to each victim before she sees that
victim's public key, so she can't know which confirmation words the keys
will produce. The confirmation words can therefore have low entropy -
for example, if the words have 20 bits of entropy, the attack will have
less than one chance in a million of going undetected.

In contrast, Serval (if I've understood correctly) gives the attacker
unlimited attempts to choose key pairs that will produce the right
confirmation words for a given pair of users. The attacker can generate
key pairs offline before the users attempt to connect and try them
against the users' public keys until she finds key pairs that produce
matching confirmation words. To make such an attack infeasible, the
confirmation words would need to have high entropy - and it takes a lot
of dictionary words to reach 128 bits of entropy.

A second issue is forward secrecy: if the shared secret is derived from
long-term key pairs, the connection can be decrypted at any time in the
future if one of the private keys is compromised. Using ephemeral key
pairs (and securely deleting the private keys after deriving the shared
secret) would avoid that problem.

I'd also like to second Hans-Christoph's comment: it's not clear what
benefit is provided by using public keys as overlay addresses. Why not
use IP addresses for routing and public keys for end-to-end
authentication, as in existing protocols?

Cheers,
Michael

Here's the proposal for an ""open yet hardened overlay network"" with similar goals to Commotion from the FreedomBox people.  I like their idea for using the host key fingerprint as a normal IPv6 address, since they can be the same length.  This allows for multiple crypto algorithms to be used, and might allow for more transparent operation.

They also have outlined a service discovery technique based on Tor called Port Santiago, but that probably relies more on having internet connectivity.

The three primary candidates are Cspace, RetroShare and Tonika. Cspace participates in a DHT which maps a public key to an IP address, but it is underdeveloped and does not appear to be currently maintained. RetroShare relies on the (unhardened) BitTorrent DHT to find addresses, and on GPG for identity verification, but these processes are distinct. Finally, Tonika is being written in Go by Maymounkov (the author of Kademlia). Tonika is perhaps the most promising candidate, though it is not well documented and (like RetroShare) includes a host of related, but superfluous functionalities.

Once a Key ID is hashed to a v6 address, that address can be queried using the Santiago mechanism, and secure, authenticated exchange of information can commence.

We want to build a network that can operate over multiple protocols,
requiring the simplest end user configuration, and the largest address

Possible use cases include small access point based networks, using
the same 192.168.X.X address space, interconnected via bluetooth or

between these separate private IP networks just wouldn't work, and we
can't expect our users to know how to resolve all of the potential

That's not to say that the overlay network couldn't be mapped directly
onto an IP network, utilising a service like DNS to map keys to global
addresses and/or public key hashes for host ID's in the FD/8 private

Although on a mesh network, it would be much better to map directly
onto layer 2 (ala batman adv. / TRILL) and skip IP routing tables
altogether as this will allow for a number of different routing tricks
that are impossible using something like olsr.

I'm curious why serval wants to avoid proven end-to-end crypto like
ZRTP, OTR, OpenPGP.  Admittedly, they have historically not been easy to
use, but OTR is proven easy and reliable.  ZRTP is recently gotten easy
in CSIPSimple for Android, as well as other apps like Twinkle for KDE.
And OpenPGP has recently gotten much easier on the desktop with
Enigmail/Thunderbird, GPGTools/Apple Mail, etc.

These protocols also have the big advantage of working regardless of
whether all users are on the mesh overlay network or not.  So for
example, if the mesh network has routes to the internet, secure
messaging can happen with any OTR or ZRTP client.

The two key issues that need to be addressed in the mesh that I can see are:

1) preventing mesh nodes from injecting bad route information

2) anonymizing the traffic on the mesh

I think using commotion-android.git makes sense.  There is currently only a single commit in the repo.  Also, I could be wrong, but it seems that the stuff that's currently there can be gotten somewhere else:

- mac2ip is already in the olsr-wifi-tether app

- olsrd and plugins build as part of olsr-wifi-tether, so we don't need the binaries

- tether-edify looks like it from Android Wifi Tether or some derivative.

- are the icons in res/drawable the official commotion ones?

My vote is to just ditch the old stuff and keep things clean.  I can just incorporate any files that we need into olsr-wifi-tether repo.  So far, the only thing I have a question about is the icons.

Yes, the HTTPINFO plugin in general and especially the admin interface is in a really bad shape because nobody used it for years. It cannot handle multiple concurrent accesses well, it consumes quite a lot of memory and the its not that useful.

At the moment OLSRd (neither stable nor development branch) is prepared
for any kind of configuration change during runtime. The only thing that
is dynamic is the IPs of the interfaces, which are scanned by OLSRd
during runtime.

The new OLSRd (v2) I am working on should resolve the problem, but doing
it for the current one will be quite a lot of work.

As a user solution it should work fine.  OLSR is just IP networking, so if one side has a VPN server, then any other node on the mesh can VPN to it.  As a general transparent solution, probably not really viable.

368,Commotion-dev, may day olsr testing report,"Wed, 2 May 2012 15:39:14 -0400",-0400,Hans-Christoph Steiner,"
http://guardianproject.info/2012/05/02/mobile-mesh-in-a-real-world-test/

Nathan, Mark, Lee, and I (all from Guardian) tried some OLSR mesh testing during the May Day protests and marches.  We were able to get 4 devices to associate and mesh together, but not without some trials and travails.  Two pairs of devices setup two separate BSSIDs, so were on separate networks.  We turned them all off, then associated  them one at a time, and then they all got onto the same BSSID and olsrd started doing its thing.  This made us think that we should just use a hard-coded BSSID in the setup, with a preference to allow standard ad-hoc association to find a BSSID.

Next we tried to use some services.  We were going to try running a cryptocat session, but the phone that was running cryptocat via a Lil' Debi Debian install was having trouble staying connected to the mesh.  Next we tried a serverless direct SIP call using CSIPSimple.  

CSIPSimple uses the Android Java API to determine if the device is online.  The current approach to configuring the ad-hoc mode used by Android-Wifi-Tether-based apps including Serval and Barnacle-based apps including OLSR-Mesh-Tether disables the wifi via the Android Java API, then configures ad-hoc mode using command line tools.  This means that Android believe that the wifi is off, and when apps query the network status via the normal Android API, Android will tell it what it believes: there is no network connection.

This works in Serval because Serval is a self-contained system with its own SIP client and server, etc.  This does not work for situations where we want to provide generic IP service using OLSR mesh on Android phones.  I'm going to try to see if I can get the ad-hoc setup to work while making Android believe that the wifi is an and associated with infrastructure-mode network.

Also, in the process of setting up the mesh while mixing in a crowd and walking with a crowd down the street we realized two key things: 1) the setup process should be tolerant of frequent interruptions, and 2) it should be as easy as possible for people to give the mesh app itself from one phone to another.  #1 is in the scope of our current Commotion work and we will focus on making a UI that clearly shows its status and lets the user continue where they left off.  #2 is outside of the scope of our Commotion work, but Guardian Project will be working directly on that issue as part of a separate project, so we'll try to keep everyone informed on our progress with that.

Another idea we discussed was how to have a ""strength meter"" for mesh, like the GSM or wifi bars.  We talked about taking a tally of how many first hop connections there are, the total connections, and the total willingness of all of the first hop connections.

Yes, we had similar issues with SipDroid connecting to localhost or
choosing codec's believing there was no available bandwidth.
But not for much longer, we've dropped asterisk and sipdroid now in a
development branch and have started to replace them.
Yes, we have a big ""Not Invented Here"" complex. But we found a number
of reasons not to use SIP's tcp session protocol and we needed
something that would be easier for us to port in future.

1) Fire a ""share"" intent with your own apk path. You can get this from
your own package info. The user can choose bluetooth to transfer the
file to another phone. Or you can look through the list of results to
find bluetooth yourself. Though not all phones have the proper
bluetooth stack to receive a file without additional software.
Samsungs work at least.

2) put the phone into hotspot mode and start a web server, again you
can find the path to your own apk and serve a copy of it.

Serval does both, in the latest version.

Kidding aside, it is interesting to see the ""all in one"" approach
develop from a usability standpoint, as opposed to our (Guardian

I had a good conversation with Henning Rogge, one of the main olsrd devs, about the txtinfo plugin and dynamic configuration possibilities.  It seems there is one parameter that we can configure at runtime: HNA.  So that means we can have in the phone GUI a button that turns on and off the sharing of the GSM/CDMA internet connection to the mesh, and the rest can stay the same.

The caveat is that the HNA information is not frequently propagated thru the mesh, so it wouldn't take effect quickly for the whole mesh.  But that's probably not a bad thing from the point of view of the user of that particular phone.

So I think that changes the approach a little bit in terms of the seven profiles that we were thinking about.  I think that we should still have the seven profiles, but the HNA/internet gateway stuff should not be included except for maybe one profile that is like the static node that always shares everything.

Glad to have your contributions on this! I'll go ahead and commit that.
 That app as it stands is the first alpha, so yea, it'll need lots more
fixes like this to make it work well.  I'm currently immersed in writing
a 'jsoninfo' plugin for olsrd which will allow the Android app to easily
get all of the information that the current txtinfo and httpinfo plugins
provide, as well as provide a way to set the HNA routes dynamically.

We then plan on making olsrd.conf files for 7ish profiles, which will be
user-selectable, that's something you could work on now, if you are
interested.

Then we'll be implementing the final round of the GUI, I'll try to post
sketches this week.

Perhaps you could also help us get some Commotion nodes setup on our
end?  We have a Buffalo and a few Foneras.  This would help us a lot

This seems like it will help with your goal (from your previous message)
of making something that helps the user evaluate their ""coverage"".

This seems like a great idea. I was imagining profiles as something that
would be a terrific idea (like you already have for the ad-hoc mode
configurations for certain devices) for selecting configurations. Do you
think that you will give the user that option on the home screen of the
app or via the Settings? That's probably more of a GUI design decision,
but I thought I'd ask.

I'd be happy to help you with this. Josh is rolling out some new builds
shortly (w/in days) so I will work with him to find out exactly which
buttons to press to make compatible images for those devices. We'll be
in touch about this soon!

378,Commotion-dev, Use case for mobile + fixed wireless OLSR?,"Tue, 8 May 2012 13:15:41 -0500",-0500,Ben West,"Hi All,

In lieu of Will Hawkins' recent recruitment for OTI mobile mesh
development (congrats, Will!), I am curious if anyone has given
thought to use cases where potential mobile devices with OLSR mesh
tether app would interoperate with fixed 802.11 hotspots running
OpenWRT/Commotion + OLSR.

That is, I personally work with meshes of fixed hotspots, and I do
understand many of the list members are envisioning meshes of perhaps
only mobile devices, e.g. for ad-hoc assemblies of people in public
plazas and the like.

Is there a particular, compelling use case to have both classes of
devices, mobile and fixed, participate in the same mesh?  E.g., is it
likely that a mostly mobile mesh might use one or two fixed hotspots
for convenient uplink to the Internet?  That is, besides letting the
mesh operate in conventional fashion, are there specific things one
could do to take advantage of the fixed hotspots (which one could
expect to have higher tx power, better rx sensitivity, and/or fast
wired uplink)?

Part of my motivation for asking is that I await a Republic Wireless
handset hopefully at some point this summer, and that phone's
proclivity to use 802.11 service over 3/4G seem to make it a natural
companion to Commotion.

I think that mobile+mesh is probably the ideal use case for reliable
mobile meshing.  The fixed devices maintain a barebones mesh and perhaps
internet HNA routes, then as the mobiles come and go, they should be
able to associate with the fixed mesh nodes.  The fixed nodes could also
have a very high willingness so that they bear the bulk of the broadcast
traffic, allowing the mobile devices to save their batteries.  I'm
guessing there are other things that we'll want to tweak.

I'm thinking these would likely be two profiles: purely mobile mesh, and
mobile mesh with fixed anchors.

380,Commotion-dev, first sketch of jsoninfo olsrd plugin,"Wed, 09 May 2012 00:50:13 -0400",-0400,Hans-Christoph Steiner,"
I just pushed the first version of the jsoninfo plugin for getting the
status and config info from olsrd in JSON format.  Right now, it gives
all of the data that the txtinfo plugin does, indeed it is based on the
txtinfo plugin.  It does not yet return the /config information.  Also,
I plan on adding the ability to configure HNAs at runtime via this
plugin (like dyn_gw_plain).

To build it:

git clone http://olsr.org/git/olsrd.git
cd olsrd
make build_all
make jsoninfo

381,Commotion-dev, Submitted DNS and configuration changes,"Thu, 10 May 2012 15:28:32 -0400",-0400,Will Hawkins,"Hello all!

I just wanted to send an update. I finished coding up some changes to
the OLSR mesh tether app that make it even more Commotion-compatible.

1. DNS: I added some code that will set a DNS server (Google's public
DNS, by default) while the user is connected to the mesh. There is a
configuration option (Advanced->Mesh) to change that value. I am going
to continue working on DNS ""stuff"" today and tomorrow. My goal is to get
the Android device to learn any name resolutions passed around in OLSR's
DNS plug-in.

2. Configuration: I changed some of the configuration screen
nomenclature and its semantics. Specifically, I changed the LAN Gateway
and LAN Netmask under Advanced->IPv4 options to properly reflect their
use for the mesh. I also added code so that the user can simply enter
the first quad of an IPv4 address and the client will generate the
remaining 3 based on the MAC address (this is how Commotion works for
OpenWRT devices). I changed the name of the entire configuration tab to
Mesh.

I hope that these are up-to-par and that they are helpful. Please let me
know if there are any changes that you want made so that they fit code
style, etc.

Talk to you soon!

I looked thru your pull request. I have a couple comments:

* why do you set the DNS via setprop?  Ideally there would be an Android Java API to do this.  I find that messing with things on the terminal level can cause weirdness in apps because the Android level gets out of sync with the lower level.  Here's an example we have to work on: turning off the wifi via Android/Java then enabling it via the shell script causes Android to think that there is no net connection.  Many apps rely on Android to tell them whether there is an net connection, so in mesh mode, these apps will think there is no net connectivitiy because that's what Android believes.

* any reason to leave brncl_lan_gw and brncl_lan_netmask variables around?  I say delete unused variables

* the variables might make more sense as ""adhoc_ip"" and ""adhoc_netmask"" since that's really what they are.  The netmask is not used at all for the meshing since olsrd will write an route entry for each node on the mesh it knows about.  The netmask is really there for a new node to establish first contact another mesh node via standard adhoc wifi IP networking.

I also just pushed updates to make commotion-android/external/olsrd now use olsr.org/git/olsrd.git since all of my updates are now included and I have commit access there.  I included your olsrd.conf commit too.

There is an API to the properties and I initially tried to use that to
set the net.dns1 property. Unfortunately, because Android considers
net.dns1 to be a ""System"" property, the Java API does not allow it to be
read or set by normal user application. There is a list of the
properties accessible via the API at
http://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/System.html#getProperty%28java.lang.String%29


As someone who never believes what they read, I tried it myself. No
luck. I had to resort to the ash script to get it to do what I wanted.


> * any reason to leave brncl_lan_gw and brncl_lan_netmask variables around?  I say delete unused variables

brncl_lan_gw and brncl_lan_netmask are required by the wifi binary
(main.cc). I didn't know if our project has ""control"" over that source
code so I maintained those variables for compatibility. If there is no
issue modifying the wifi source code, then I can change those variable
references and get rid of unused variables.

I think that those are great names! I stumbled around for names until I
settled on the mesh_ prefix. We should change them to adhoc_ because, I
agree, those are better names.

On a semi-related note, I realized that I never quite figured out how
you prefer to be addressed? Do you prefer Hans, Hans-Christoph, Your

The patch looks good, and the 'git diff' is ok.  But 'git format-patch' makes much nicer patches that apply nicely with 'git am'.  'git format-patch' saves all of the commit info, so when I include it with 'git am', it looks exactly like the commit in your repo.

I have finished digging thru the txtinfo and httpinfo plugins, as well as other parts of the olsrd source.  The jsoninfo plugin now gives you all of the info in httpinfo and txtinfo, as well as some other info that is not in either.

I tried to make the JSON key names human-readable while still making sense with the OLSR terminology.  I'd appreciate feedback on the key names and data format, and whether they make sense.

The trickiest thing for the user of the OlsrMeshTether app remains the ad-hoc network associating.  If a bunch of phones are starting up at the same time, they can easily start associating with themselves in clusters.  Then there is multiple meshes that can't talk to each other.

It seems a simple solution to this is to just hard-code the BSSID for Commotion in general as a default, then allow people to change this if they really want to.  I propose using CC:CC:CC:CC:CC:CC as the static BSSID.

Is there any reason why we wouldn't want to use a static BSSID as the default?

The Java package name needs to change for the current OLSRMeshTether app.  Any ideas for a new name?  This would also be related to the name of the app itself. At the very least it should be something based on net.commotionwireless.  This is the current idea I have:

app name: MeshTether
java package: net.commotionwireless.meshtether

""wifi tether"" is a whole genre of Android apps, so this would link the

My guess is that this is not a good idea to include in the madwifi driver, since it goes against how the Ad-hoc standard is supposed to work, and it would hinder interoperability with other implementations outside of madwifi (other Linux drivers, Windows, BSD, Mac OS X, etc.)

But for mesh use, this makes perfect sense from what I can see since more mesh nodes on the same SSID mean a better network, versus with standard Ad-hoc, multiple networks with the same SSID would mean interference, both on the wifi level, and things like multiple DHCP servers, etc.

I just wanted to give everyone an update on what's going on here: I am
working on adding capability to the client to handle DNS entries
distributed in the mesh (via olsr nameservice plugin). Because Android's
/etc/hosts file is on the readonly file system, simply telling olsrd to
write out an /etc/hosts file (like it would normally do on a *nix host)
does not work.

So, I cross-compiled a small (300k) DNS server that the app invokes when
the user connects to the mesh. This server answers queries by first
looking for an answer in an /etc/hosts-formatted file. If there are no
matches, the DNS server forwards the request.

In my testing it works fairly well. I am still integrating it into the
build but I wanted to give everyone an update.

Talk to you all soon!

Aaron Kaplan of olsr.org pointed out something: the generated, static BSSID should also take into account the wifi channel that the mesh is running on so that there isn't two conflicting mesh networks with the same ESSID/BSSID.  So really this should be a hash of the ESSID and the channel.

Sounds good.  Is this setup meant to be only for Android or other platforms too?  I ask because it'll probably be easier to manage a pure Java DNS server as an Android Service than adding another C binary.

As for writing out a non-standard file like /etc/hosts-formatted, if you are writing a custom file, then it should go into the app's file hierarchy.  It is important to avoid touching the filesystem as much as possible.  This file could go into /data/data/net.szym.barnacle/app_bin or we could create ...../app_etc or something like that.

Is this being tracked by a ticket on the Commotion dev site? I am all
for rapid innovation, but I think we need to keep track of both bugs and
new feature efforts, and redmine is great way to do that. Pushing
discussion of a feature like this to a relevant ticket is a better way
to keep track of decisions than on the broader list.

This setup is meant now only for Android, but it could be useful for
other platforms that do not readily support /etc/hosts-formatted files.
In all honesty I never considered a Java DNS implementation that could
simply run in a separate thread. That is something that I will
definitely look into.

As for the files themselves, these do go into the app-local data

system beyond that. I'm sorry if there was confusion in my previous

424,Commotion-dev, DNS Update,"Wed, 16 May 2012 13:01:16 -0400",-0400,Will Hawkins,"I uploaded a set of patches to redmine that should implement this.
Please take a look at your convenience and provide feedback. I am eager
to hear what you think.

To get the new feature, follow the instructions in the README (basically
update android.env and run ./build_external.sh).

As an overview, here's how the new dns setup works:

On connection to the mesh,
1. the user's DNS server preference is taken from the preferences and
stashed in app_bin/resolv.conf
2. The system-wide dns server is set to 127.0.0.1
3. adsuck (the name of the dns server binary) is launched. Its pid is
stored in the app_bin/adsuck.pid file.
4. olsrd is started with a properly configured nameservice plug-in.
At this point, adsuck is now ready to do .mesh -> address translations.

When olsrd receives an updated DNS entry,
1. The mapping is automatically reflected in
app_bin/chroot/hosts.android.small.
2. The adsuck process (whose pid is found in app_bin/adsuck.pid) is
signalled with HUP to indicate that there were changes to its data source.
3. adsuck rereads app_bin/chroot/hosts.android.small.

On disconnection from the mesh,
1. The application resets the system-wide dns server to what it was
before connecting.

Please let me know if this makes sense. I am eager to get feedback on
the approach and how it works. It's pretty cool to be able to go to
http://commotion-xxxx.mesh from the Android browser.

I think there was some idea that Commotion was the umbrella brand, while
this app was just one feature or instance of that.

Commotion MeshConnect, perhaps?

I think also, from the pure open-source, open-protocol side of things,
we are still thinking of this as a generic OLSRd Android app, that just
so happens to work with Commotion-based mesh quite well.

We can change the label of the app outside of the formal name of the app
within the code itself. In addition, we have a standard EULA Mechanism
that pops up on first run, which can be used to inform the user of the
current state of the software.

434,Commotion-dev, Possible hardware defect with POE passthru on,"Wed, 16 May 2012 15:54:05 -0500",-0500,Ben West,"I observed a problem on a recent generation 00:27:... Nanostation M5
(mfg date ~August 2011) bricking itself upon enabling the POE
passthrough feature (via firmware) shortly after boot.

The unit did not become bricked simply from flashing it, but rather
failed upon the passthrough enable.  Also, nothing was connected to
its secondary LAN port at the time; it was sitting on the bench.

I have not experienced this failure upon enabling the POE passthru
feature, with stock firmware and otherwise, on older NSM5 units.
Maybe there was a BOM change.

I found recent reports of other UBNT users experiencing the same
failure enabling the POE passthrough feature on Nanostation M2 and
M5s, when using stock firmware too:
https://forum.ubnt.com/showthread.php?p=270549

The suggested work-around, which I have so far tested successfully, is
to NOT enable POE passthrough, presumably with any firmware.  Rather,
swap the Main and Secondary LAN ports, i.e. so that whatever secondary
POE device is connected to Main.  This will have the effect of the 2nd
POE device being always on.

This work-around comes with caveat of possibly reduced power noise
filtering, since the unit will not be receiving its power from the
Main port.

Also, do please note UBNT's warranty policy of not supporting 3rd
party firmware, even despite their wiki providing instructions for
flashing OpenWRT onto their products:
http://www.ubnt.com/support/warranty

(So, recommendation is to prove out all units with UBNT stock firmware
first, especially POE passthru, to screen for any problems.)

One thing we came across in our Vienna testing days (which actually given a second thought is pretty obvious):
different ESSIDs, same BSSID but different channels still results in some roque packets from the other channel to arrive at the network stack.

Therefore - for multi-channel setups - I'd recommend:
* different channel implies different BSSIDs 
* keep BSSIDs static

Most drivers can still cope with (different ESSID, same BSSID, same channel)
However, some drivers are known to get confused in this setup.

Hope this info helps,
Aaron.

But as it is written here:

is  not true

I would say the more nodes on *different* channels but somehow connected to each other (LAN), the better the network.

Use cable whenever you can :) It keeps those darn radio waves contained hehe.

I think I have a very very neat solution for this. Can show it to you next time we meet.

If you have multiple mesh nodes radiating on the same frequency in the same area, so that the radio waves overlap, is there ever a time with an OLSR mesh where it would be preferable to have those nodes on separate BSSIDs?  That's the case I'm talking about.

For Ad-hoc networks, if your neighbor happens to be radiating on the same frequency, that doesn't mean you want to your ad-hoc network to merge with theirs.  That would cause confusion with DHCP servers, different IP ranges and devices on the network, different internet connections, etc.

Yes, you actually could think about that. 
Why? Because you limit the number of neighbors this way. And then you get smaller OLSR  packets.

But in general: if the density of nodes on the same frequencies is too high, then you are in trouble. No matter which protocol.

Talked about this with Hans today. We came up with the following algorithm:

BSSID = MD4(ESSID)[0:4] ++ channel 2-byte integer

This is read in English as: ""The six byte BSSID is the first four
bytes of the MD4 hash of ESSID concatenated with the lowest two bytes
of the channel.""

The rationale for this is that MD4 is uniformly distributed, and the
first four bytes of MD4 are presumably uniformly distributed. (Should
be distributed enough.) Then add on the bytes of the channel so that
same ESSIDs don't collide. MD4 was an arbitrary function choice, and
security is not an issue. :)

I found a public domain implementation of MD4
<http://openwall.info/wiki/people/solar/software/public-domain-source-code/md4>
and made a simple get_bssid() function the same as the above algorithm
(attached).

Signature for get_bssid:

get_bssid(char *essid, unsigned int channel, unsigned char *bssid) //
(result goes in bssid)

Not sure how to add this in, so hope one of you goes ahead and does
that, or let me know how I can be of further service.

448,Commotion-dev," Compiled images for ath5k, ar71xx,","Mon, 21 May 2012 02:40:17 -0500",-0500,Ben West,"Hi All,

In aftermath from Friday's hackathon, here are recent compiled
Commotion-opewrt images for ath5k and ath9k targets, including the
.config files I used and images for UBNT M and Buffalo devices:
http://info.gowasabi.net/commotion-openwrt/openwrt/

I have so far successfully flashed these devices, and afterwards
telnetted into 192.168.1.20 to configure them:
- a really crusty old FON2100 (openwrt-atheros-root.squashfs and
openwrt-atheros-vmlinux.lzma)
- UBNT Nanostation Loco M2
(openwrt-ar71xx-generic-ubnt-nano-m-squashfs-factory.bin)
- UBNT Bullet M2 (openwrt-ar71xx-generic-ubnt-bullet-m-squashfs-factory.bin)

After telnetting into each device to set a root password, I rebooted
them.  All 3 nodes are now meshing w/ each other (can ping / ssh
between them), confirming basic operation of both the ath5k ad ath9k
drivers.

Do note the ath5k images DO NOT have any luci packages compiled into
the images, but are available as separate *.ipk files at the URL
above.  I did this since the FON has only 16MB RAM, and just the bare
image w/o the web UI leaves less than 1MB in free RAM.  Newer ath5k
devices like the Open Mesh OM1P and Engenius EOC-1650 should have at
least 32MB RAM to handle the web UI.

Finally, leading from discussion on IRC, I added a support ticket
requesting periodic (e.g. nightly or weekly) snapshot builds located
on the code.commotionwireless.net server for popular targets like
ath5k and ar71xx.

455,Commotion-dev, Some speed tests for ar71xx and ath5k devices,"Tue, 22 May 2012 00:20:57 -0500",-0500,Ben West,"Here are some results of speed tests I did with the two UBNT M and
FON2100 devices I had sitting around, using the version of the
commotion-openwrt from 5/18/12.  These download speeds were recorded
while connected to the public AP of each node.

I tried a couple variations of this 3-node mesh, one with a Nano Loco
M2 as gateway node (i.e. fastest device) and another with a FON2100 as
gateway (slowest device).  All repeaters were only 1 hop away from the
gateway.

Speed tests (via speedtest.net) with Nano M2 as gateway node
~15Mbit/s download thru Nano Loco M2 public AP (gateway node), which
is prbly the limit of my broadband connection
~10Mbit/s download thru Bullet M2 public AP (repeater node)
~6Mbit/s download thru FON2100 public AP (repeater node)

Speed tests with FON2100 as gateway node
~11Mbit/s download thru FON2100 public AP (gateway node)
~8Mbit/s download thru Bullet M2 public AP (repeater node)
~7.5Mbit/s download thru Nano Loco M2 public AP (repeater node)

There tests were overall quite favorable!  My immediate point of
comparison, the ROBIN mesh firmware based on OpenWRT Kamikaze +
madwifi, would likely only achieve 60-70% of these speeds using ath5k
devices.  Which is awesome!

These tests were done with all devices in the same room, so certainly
not realistic w.r.t. to RSSI.  I tuned the 2 UBNT nodes down to 10dB
output power, but I still saw reported signal strengths in 35-45dB
range.  Real world speeds might actually be better, since having all
the nodes in one room certainly was causing interference.

Note that the version of commotion-openwrt I used didn't appear to
have a working instance of dnsmasq yet, so I performed the following
steps on each node to get basic connectivity from the public AP:

- I manually configured my wifi adapter's IP address to be in the
101.x.x.x range used by the target node's public AP.
- I ran ""/etc/init.d/luci_splash stop"" on each node to kill
(non-working?) splash page.
- I also ran ""/etc/init.d/qos stop"" on each node, even tho qos
supposedly disabled.  Just in case.

There was a little confusion in my schedule, the developer day turns out is only a dinner, so I'm free until 6pm.  I could come work out of OTI, if that makes sense.

I just realized, if anyone is starting up a new build, that you need to
create a map (new map button) before you can add landmarks (landmarks write

Also, there is a secret button in the top left corner to add buildings,
flora, etc (admin stuff I haven't implemented because there are no accounts

click to drop it on the map...you can add any locally hosted images to the

Can you please clarify something for me...

1) Do this need to interface to tidepools.co
2) can it be setup standalone, on a private mesh, without external
connectivity, using a local map server?

I had dinner with Lucas Dixon a small group at a dinner organized by a couple Google people on Tuesday as a precursor to Internet at Liberty.  Last night at the conference dinner, I happened to be sitting next to him again, and he turned to me and said something like ""I really think that its important that Android support Ad-hoc mode"".  Needless to say, I agreed and gave him lots of information why.  He said he's been talking to the google dev who works on that part of Android, and he's overburdened.  He's been trying to line up other google devs to work on this as part of their 20% time.  We agreed to start an email conversation with those devs with the goal of: a) figuring out what needs to be done, and b) putting together an internal proposal to get google resources officially assigned to it.

I saw Lucas again as we left today, and we reiterated this.  So I'll keep you posted on this.

Sounds like a plan.  I can contribute how olsrd works with the Android app and also some notes on the app itself, but I don't have a strong sense of the whole Commotion picture, so I'll leave that part up to others.

Anyone who might be working on the Android client: I just updated the Eclipse project to also build the native side when building the Java side.  To make this work on your Eclipse, you need to install Sequoyah and CDT:

He's said one big reason why its not in there already is there is only one overworked dev in charge of that aspect.  We want to convene a very small group of people to discuss what needs to happen and how, then we can make a work plan and also help make an internal Google proposal to try to get an internal resource assigned to it.  We can also contribute patches to ensure this happens sooner rather than later.

IMHO, there will be a lot of overlap on wiki topics between all of the subprojects, so if we have separate wikis for each, then it'll be hard to organize the info that spans subprojects.  Examples of this are anything to do with olsrd configuration, mesh status monitoring, etc.  Commotion-manual, commotion-devdocs, commotion-android, commotion-linux, commotion-mac, commotion-openwrt, commotion-windows and OLSRd subprojects all will have this kind of info overlapping.

And on a related note, it seems that the OLSRd subproject is empty and redundant. Perhaps it should be removed?  I think any fixes we need can just be contributed directly upstream to olsr.org.

I haven't tried it and it is theoretically possible, but it would be very impractical. USB-to-go does not power the USB devices, do you'd have to include a powered USB hub in order to power the wifi dongle.  Just having a wifi dongle sticking out of your phone or tablet would be bad enough, now imagine having a battery-powered USB hub also.

I could maybe see one use case in repurposing old Android devices as static mesh routers.

Right, but just the way they describe it, it does not seem like mesh, at
all, in the technical sense.

It seems like a great user concept, and a great user experience for
managing access from a variety of devices or people to the internet
backhaul on your phone or 3g-enabled laptop or tablet.

Anyhow, I could be wrong. It just raises the hairs on my neck in the
same way that people through around terms like ""secure"" or ""private""...
and of course also ""mesh"".

I would be glad to be wrong, and I should probably just play with it myself.

531,Commotion-dev, Better understanding of meshconfig tool in,"Fri, 8 Jun 2012 14:09:35 -0500",-0500,Ben West,"Hi All,

I see that the boot script /etc/init.d/meshconfig in Commotion OpenWRT
looks to do much of the heavy lifting in configuring a node, and that
this tool is unique to Commotion rather than taken from another source
(like meshwizard).  I fully understand this tool is still under
development, and that issues were just filed today on Redmine asking
for documentation.  Just trying to get a better idea of where to
start.

I was able to get several nodes meshing together using OpenWRT r31639
a few weeks back, but attempts so far with r32002 are falling flat.
So, the original behavior of those functioning nodes is a bit of a
mystery.

>From what I've observed so far, a newly flashed node upon 1st boot
should broadcast the following SSIDs on channel 5, and these are set
by the apply_wireless_defaults() function in /etc/init.d/meshconfig,
correct?

CommotionSetup-ap (public AP)
CommotionSetup-secure (encrypted AP)
CommotionSetup-mesh (adhoc)

After a node receives its unique configuration, whereby it gets a
assigned a unique numerical ID like 2022497, it should then broadcast
these SSIDs instead, which are also set by the meshconfig script,
correct?

commotion_2022497_ap (public AP)
commotion_2022497_secure (private AP)
commotionwireless.net (adhoc)

How is the per-node configuration supposed to occur?  I.e. is the node
supposed to configure itself upon 1st or 2nd boot?  Is the user
supposed to SSH into 192.168.1.20 to issue commands at the prompt?
Or, is the user supposed to connect wirelessly to one of the node's
""CommotionSetup"" APs and enter config info thru a web UI?

Likewise, how does a node know whether it is a gateway (e.g. wired
uplink on its LAN port) or just a repeater?  Is it supposed to
automatically detect presence of an upstream DHCP server on its LAN
port, or must these roles be specified explicitly under /etc/...

Thanks.

MeshTether is substantially based on Barnacle Wifi Tether, which is
GPLv3, so it'll be easiest there to just keep that license.

jsoninfo is pretty much all written under Commotion funding, but is part
of olsrd, so it should probably use that license (I think MIT or BSD).

The OlsrInfo java library is all new code, so it can easily be whatever
license.

Its an interesting idea, but I think that getting root for that thread
is the hard part.  I think its worth trying but perhaps after we have a
simple Java wrapper for the olsrd.

I think this is the kind of thing they are trying to support in the
olsrd rewrite, since its all framework-based.

At the very least, it would be interesting to see if there is another
workable approach to getting root for operations on Android.  From what
I've seen, everything is using 'su' to start a process.

None of the licenses discussed so far put any restriction on commercial
use.  To support its use in proprietary software, it would have to be
LGPL, Apache, or BSD.  olsrd is already BSDish, and Mesh Tether is based
on a lot of GPLv3 code, so that will need to be the same.  OlsrInfo can
be anything since that's all written under Commotion's banner.  In terms
of issuing separate licenses for purchase, that can't be done for Mesh
Tether since there are outside copyright holders for code that is GPLv3.

Yes, if something only works together with OLSR (such as plugins), it would make sense to keep it the same license (BSD license in this case). 
I wouldn't like to see a balkanization of licenses in the olsr.org code repo. This will create headaches for olsr.org in the years to come. Easier to keep it under one license (even though personally I don't like the implications of BSD license so much).

The GUI that's there is just what was inherited from Barnacle WIfi Tether, here's the planned GUI:

Noted, that's a good idea.

A known bug due to cramming olsrd into Barnacle.  Will is taking on writing a proper Java daemon wrapper so that should be fixed soon.

The final version will likely only use the jsoninfo plugin, which uses the much less common port 9090.  If port conflicts are still an issue, I think that the best solution is to modify jsoninfo to optionally use a UNIX socket.

Interesting, so are you thinking that you'll rely on Commotion Mesh Tether to provide Adhoc+OLSR?  This definitely is worth a feature request in redmine.

Following the way this app works, I think the Intents would be TOGGLE_STATE and CHOOSE_PROFILE.  Then we should probably have the option of importing profiles via a JSON file, so that other apps can add the profile they need to MeshTether.

Sounds like a good idea.  I agree with Ben, I think that Debian would be the best approach.

I'm working on making the olsrd package in Debian as easy and plug-n-play as possible.  Its not a small project, so your contributions there would fulfill your goal and also contribute to the creater Debian ecosystem.

564,Commotion-dev, repo for OlsrInfo Java API?,"Thu, 21 Jun 2012 15:50:25 -0400",-0400,Hans-Christoph Steiner,"
I'm just finishing up the OlsrInfo Java API and I was wondering where I
should put the git repo.  I am currently pushing here:

https://github.com/guardianproject/OlsrInfo

This is a separate project from Commotion-Android i.e. MeshTether, so
I've kept it in a separate repo and include it in MeshTether as a jar.

For fixes to olsrd itself, I'm committing them directly upstream.  Then
I'm working on scripts to make it easy to setup the adhoc mode for a
given mesh, you can see that in the latest olsrd in
files/olsrd-adhoc-setup or in the latest Debian package.

Right now we're also working on ""profiles"" for a given mesh network
which includes a olsrd.conf as well as settings outside of olsrd like
the wifi SSID, wifi channel, IP address, netmask, DNS settings, etc.
This is first going to manifest itself in the Android app, but then
later in Network Manager.  For your project, we should think about how
best to manage these profiles when working with a headless node.

We tried this image and were able to get something working.  But we had to manually setup the wifi settings, tweak the olsrd.conf, and manually start olsrd.  Did we miss something or is this image not yet setup to do commotion by default?

I was having lots of problems getting Commotion to work under OpenWRT trunk
r32002 and newer, due to recent changes made to kernel and I think to
netifd.
https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/31640/
https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/32049/

This is what prompted my question to this list about how the meshconfig
tool works (the tool that handles node auto-config), since it apparently
stopped working for newer versions of trunk.

I do have compiled ar71xx and atheros images from when I reverted Commotion
back to trunk r31639, and I though I had published them to info.gowasabi.net,
but I may have misplaced them.

I will look and respond later today.

As far as methodology, I cut out each of the screen mockups and had
people navigate the app as though it were an actual phone, handing them
new pages based on their behavior. I had a mix of technical and
nontechnical users, with most of the technical users being members of
the Commotion dev team. All were android users.

Behavior and expectations were fairly close between both groups, though
the technical users (mostly members of the commotion dev team) were able
to make better educated guesses when they got stuck. Novice users tended
to explore, but mostly kept the default settings.

I found the working Commotion-OpenWRT images I had compiled for atheros and
ar71xx targets, after reverting back to known functional OpenWRT trunk
r31639.

I've but them back online here, and any further experiments with newer
versions of trunk will be put at separate location:
http://info.gowasabi.net/commotion-openwrt/openwrt/

Also, do please note that I excluded all luci-related packages from the
atheros images.  The FON2100 I have just can't fit everything into its 16MB
of RAM.  All the separate *.ipk package files, tho, are still downloadable
here:

The ar71xx images, however, do have the luci packages included.

576,Commotion-dev, Help w/ Commotion dev/deployment for upcoming,"Sun, 24 Jun 2012 18:45:00 -0500",-0500,Ben West,"Hi All,

(Shout outs to Nina B. and Benjamin C.!)

In lieu of the upcoming Allied Media Conference in Detroit next weekend (
http://amc.alliedmedia.org/) is there need for assistance w/ pushing thru
progress on any low-hanging fruit in the Commotion OpenWRT issue queue?
https://code.commotionwireless.net/projects/commotion-openwrt/issues

I was not sure if folks were planning a small (or large?) mesh deployment
at AMC.  If so, are there any things folks would like to see working by
next weekend if possible, e.g.

- Better splash page operation?
- CoovaChilli integration, in case captive portal integration is desired?
- Cloudtrax dashboard integration (to generate live mesh status maps)?
- Alternatively, munin or nagios integration for automated node status
reporting?
- Documentation on flashing Commotion and basic operation, including remote
flashing?

P.S. As a reminder, I've re-published my working images atheros and ar71xx
of Commotion OpenWRT here.
http://info.gowasabi.net/commotion-openwrt/openwrt/

They're based on the last known compatible version of OpenWRT trunk r31639,
since newer versions r32002+ have updates to the kernel and/or netifd that
appear to break Commotion's meshconfig tool.  Again, do note the
atheros/ath5k images do not have luci, etc compiled in due to RAM
constraints on my FON2100's, but the *.ipk files are still there for
download.

P.P.S. I can not travel to Detroit myself, unfortunately.  I'm pinging the
list here, since I'm hoping to knock out a bunch pending tasks on
Commotion/ROBIN/WasabiNet/etc queue this week.

577,Commotion-dev, Better understanding of meshconfig tool in,"Mon, 25 Jun 2012 01:56:07 -0500",-0500,Ben West,"For follow-up on this thread, here is what I've observed about getting
Commotion nodes to configure themselves and mesh ...

Upon first boot after flashing, the node should broadcast the following
SSIDs on channel 5, and these are set by the /etc/init.d/meshconfig script.

CommotionSetup-ap (public AP)
CommotionSetup-secure (encrypted AP)
CommotionSetup-mesh (adhoc)

Shortly after first boot (how long?), the node will be assigned a unique
numerical ID like 2022497.  I think the node also converts its root
filesystem from squashfs to jffs during this time too, meaning it shouldn't
be powered down.

The meshconfig script will then update the SSID's broadcast by the node as
such:

commotion_2022497_ap (public AP)
commotion_2022497_secure (private AP)
commotionwireless.net (adhoc)

At this point, the nodes should be able to automatically distinguish which
is a repeater and which is a gateway node, meshing with each other over the
""commotionwireless.net"" signal.  Likewise, each node will accept wifi
clients on both their public and private APs (WPA key ""c0MM0t10N!r0ckS!""),
displaying the Commotion splash page on your first port 80 request if that
was compiled in.

details already, tho I think a bit out of date now:

Fonera last year to simply repeat to the timeout/passworded campus
network but without the hassle of password and timeouts.  I loved it.

A potentially interesting challenge is that, as I recall, the high-use
campus network areas frequently suffered capacity problems, so I'd often
wander off to a remote hallway (part of that was probably my laptop's
finicky WiFi too).  A mesh uplinked with the campus network in several
locations could theoretically help spread traffic and diffuse the
capacity problem, though I don't recall anything in olsrd which would
automaticaly adapt or change the 0/0 route to make that actually happen.

584,Commotion-dev," Working compiled images for atheros and ar71xx,","Thu, 28 Jun 2012 04:42:05 -0500",-0500,Ben West,"Howdy All,

Sorry if this is too late for the mesh deployment underway at AMC.

I just published a bunch of new images for ar71xx, atheros, and
stripped-down images for FONs.
 The stripped-down ""atheros-ar2315-minimal"" images for FON do not have the
luci web UI or the splash page, but they will mesh fine.  The un-stripped
atheros and ar71xx images do have luci and the splash page, both of which
worked OK in testing.

It took a while to get the stripped-down Commotion OpenWRT working reliably
for FON2100's.  It may just be the FONs I was testing with, but I found
they will spontaneously reboot (or just lock up) if they run out of free
RAM.

http://info.gowasabi.net/commotion-openwrt/openwrt/bin/
    |-- bin
        |-- ar71xx Full Commotion OpenWRT images for ar71xx nodes
        |-- atheros Slightly stripped-down Commotion OpenWRT images for
atheros nodes w/ 32MB RAM, e.g. OM1P, EOC-1650
        `-- atheros-ar2315-minimal Minimal Commotion OpenWRT images for
atheros AR2315 nodes w/ 16MB RAM (e.g. FON2100), no luci web UI

All of these images have a default root password r0ot56c0MM0t10N, so the
ar71xx nodes can be flashed remotely w/ the sysupgrade tool.  You should
still be able to SSH into each node's LAN port at IP 192.168.1.20, too.

I was even able to reflash a node remotely via the SSH console, although,
again, the sysupgrade tool won't with the atheros nodes, just ar71xx nodes.

585,Commotion-dev," OLSR sensitivity to node's local time,","Thu, 28 Jun 2012 05:02:05 -0500",-0500,Ben West,"I'm starting this as a separate thread, in case the problem also arises for
the folks testing on Android.

I've found that if a repeater node boots up with its local time grossly out
of sync (ath5k devices especially), and it is unable to sync its local time
via ntpdate, then it may not find its gateway route and thus not pass any
client traffic.  The node will still be accessible to SSH from other nodes
on the mesh, so you can login manually to set a default route and update
local time, but the OLSR assignment of default route appears to fail until
local time is updated.

A further complication is that a repeater node with badly out-of-sync local
time seems to also cause neighboring repeater nodes to also not find their
default route, i.e. spreading the problem to more than one node.  This
problem, as I've observed it, is extremely sporadic.  E.g. rebooting all
nodes in the mesh can fix it.

The best measure I've found to avoid the problem is to use the OLSR
SmartGateway feature (which Commotion OpenWRT does), along with a recurring
ntpdate job that periodically sync the node's local time.  That is, if
ntpdate doesn't succeed on boot-up due to no Internet access, it will run
again (and again) after a few minutes, until the gateway node is available.
 (The images I just published in the previous thread do this.)

I had posed this question on the olsr-users listserv a while back, although
no one was quite sure what caused the problem.  OLSRd itself shouldn't have
a hard dependency on whether the node's local time is in sync.

Finally, do please note this problem is not unique to Commotion.  I've
experienced it on mesh nodes running ROBIN and plain vanilla OpenWRT
Backfire.

589,Commotion-dev, network profiles in Mesh Tether,"Thu, 28 Jun 2012 14:05:16 -0400",-0400,Hans-Christoph Steiner,"
I think the confusion over the ""profiles"" in the Mesh Tether app stems
from the vague term ""profile"" and lack of context.  These profiles are
network profiles, i.e. all of the settings needed to connect to an OLSR
mesh network.  Here's a quick example:

commotionwireless.net:
	SSID: commotionwireless.net
	BSSID: 02:ca:ff:ee:ba:be
	channel: 5
	DNS: 8.8.8.8 + plugin 127.0.0.1
	LinkQualityAlgorithm ""etx_ffeth""
	IP root: 10.
	netmask: 255.0.0.0


funkfeuer:
	SSID: freiesnetz.www.funkfeuer.at die
	BSSID: 4E:FE:52:36:2E:65
	channel: 1
	DNS: 193.238.157.16
	LinkQualityAlgorithm ""etx_ff""
	IP root: statically assigned, real IPs


And so on and so forth.  The idea is that each profile represents how to
connect to a mesh.  It is a quick and dirty version of the wifi browser
that must be manually configured.  Hopefully, this won't be the final
idea, but before we can do a proper scanner and browser, there is much
work to be done (IP address assignment techniques, SSIDs as mesh
descriptor, etc.).

"
590,Commotion-dev, network profiles in Mesh Tether,"Thu, 28 Jun 2012 14:15:13 -0400",-0400,David Oliver,"Hans,

Thanks so much for this clarification.

I do think we're missing something, still, however.  We know that olsrd -
the actual daemon software - has many operational parameters.  It's a
problem, however, that we don't really have a good idea what modifying
those parameters means, and we don't have a good idea if or how modifying
such parameters will improve or ruin mesh network connectivity and
performance when mobile networks (and intermittent network users on mobile
devices) are involved.

What this implies to me is that even under the (future) circumstances where
we have an easier ability to discover and connect to mesh networks (which
your definition of the ""profile"" addresses), we do not yet know if, upon
connection, there are other settings/configurations necessary to optimize
performance for specific mesh situations.    Thus, unlike WiFi, there may
need to be two ""layers"" here: (a) connection and (b) optimizing performance.

When I wrote up the scenarios earlier on (and proposed seven profiles,
mostly just dreaming them up since we have no knowledge to support them), I
intended them to be separate from ""network settings"" (network connection
parameters).  Overall, though, my current feeling is that we simply lack
the proper knowledge to understand this second portion and we should just
leave it for the experimenters to discover for us.

596,Commotion-dev, complete Android GUI mockups,"Wed, 20 Jun 2012 13:13:35 -0400",-0400,Michael Gregor,"Thanks so much for sharing your UI mockups. They were very useful in giving us some more perspective and ideas for the HIG, which we are writing now. I've included some draft sections of the HIG below - feel free to use this in your development or send me back your comments on things you feel strongly about.

Also, please read this when you get a chance to see some of our ideas: https://blog.commotionwireless.net/blog/2012/05/user-interface-prototype-what-commotion-software-could-look

Here's a compilation of our thoughts on the design you proposed. Some of it may be redundant with conversations with OTI.

It would be best to use the common language proposed below.
It would be best to use the Commotion colors, typeface, and other brand assets. You can find the complete usage guidelines at https://blog.commotionwireless.net/files/Commotion%20Brand.pdf and the individual files at nina.inst7.thermitic.net/commotion_assets061912.zip
We like the status bar icon idea, which we hadn't thoroughly considered before. We do think that the icon should be a signal strength bar instead of color-coded. Users are far more familiar with strength bars on their cell phones and computers. We will draft an icon that could be used here.
It's unclear to us why profiles are necessary and seem to complicate the process. From our understanding, the basic user will only need to occasionally set their network name and channel. Are there reasons why a basic user would need to save more than that? We're unsure of the rationale. 
We think that the network status page should be displayed differently: simply using text for this phase of the project. In future iterations, it would be great to see visualizations. We're concerned that the hexagon layout cannot accurately represent the real world (arrangement of nodes in space) and can be confusing due to fundamental geometric restraints. In the HIG, we're going to propose a simple status page and mention that developers could use some sort of network visualization tool in the advanced area.
We're also thinking of including the log in the native menu in Android or in the green footer on all other applications.
We like the notification concept!

Let us know if you have feedback on anything here.

All the best,

Michael

luci sounds interesting, can luci export all the olsrd data that available in txtinfo or httpinfo (things like HNA, neighbors, links, etc.)?  I've ended up putting additional status data into jsoninfo as well.  In any case, sounds like there should be some kind of merge between jsoninfo and luci, for openwrt nodes at least.  luci probably won't help us on everything else.

As for jsoninfo, I highly recommend using the version from git, rather than the version in the 0.6.3 release.  There have been many improvements and bugfixes.

Ok, the attached patch worked.  I got it integrated in and its working for me.  Yay, we can finally stop olsrd from the GUI!

One thing I think we could improve is running a single root shell which we feed commands too.  That means SuperUser would only ask once for root access, not for each command.  That makes it much easier to use MeshTether without having to grant it automatic root access.

One other detail: we should probably check if an olsrd is left running in onCreate() or something.  If MeshTether crashes (shudder the thought) it'll leave olsrd running.  Or even better, find a way to always kill olsrd when MeshTether crashes.

This is my understanding as well.

I have attached an example olsrd.conf file from a running node. The
subnets announced using HNA are automatically selected based on the
node's running configuration. You will see where other parameters are
determined based upon the node's configuration (e.g., nameservice, p2pd).

I hope this helps,

This is a very good idea. The reason that I shied away from this in the past is that getting the quoting of parameters right for 'su -c' is tricky. Having said that, it is definitely import for usability that the user need not press ""Grant"" over and over. On Thursday I will start to work through this and channel all calls through the su_c shell script.

Good thought. I will check on this and make the necessary changes!

The default olsrd.conf's that I've seen in packages for other distros 
have typically had a lot more comments in them, clarifying the options. 
So if you're suggesting replacing a the default .conf file in the 
Debian repo, it might be better to take the existing default file, 
change the settings to be in line with the settings in this file (minus 
the HNAs and Interface addressing, given that those are node-specific)

The idea here is an example olsrd.conf for running networks.  The default olsrd.conf is the one with all the comments, that's staying.  What I'm doing now is collecting real world examples to put into /usr/share/doc/olsrd/examples.  These should be the opposite of the default olsrd.conf in that they should only have the things that need to be set in there.

Then people can just copy the conf file from there when setting up a node for a given network.  There are already files for funkfeuer and freifunk there.  These also serve as a good example for ""best practices"" when people are creating their own meshes.

Agreed, that is a nice bit of code!

However, what it comes down to is that if you call ""su"" as your exec
command, then write to the outputstream after that, then the user will
only be prompted once for root.

Process proc = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(""su"");
proc.getOutputStream().write(""foobin arg1 arg2"");

Our less elegant doShellCommand() here is an example of this same
phenomenon:

629,Commotion-dev, virtualbox and commotion,"Sun, 15 Jul 2012 19:35:10 -0500",-0500,Ben West,"I added a section to Sean's VirtualBox/Commotion writeup, with a rough
draft on options for using VirtualBox to simulate multiple nodes on a mesh.

https://code.commotionwireless.net/projects/commotion/wiki/Virtual-Box

My understanding is that VirtualBox will let you create internal networks
b/w VMs under the same host, which could be used to simulate the mesh,
public APs, and private APs?  All such networks, however, would operate as
logical wired networks, but possibly this is still useful to test out
things like UI or captive portals w/o endless re-flashing of physical nodes.

This would require tweaking meshconfig to properly deploy network config on
a virtual OpenWRT node.

Furthermore, maybe one could create a 3-node virtual mesh of OpenWRT nodes,
and then add a 4th VM running Windows/Ubuntu to simulate a client
connection?

A final interesting detail is the mac80211 hwsim module, which lets you
simulate wireless interfaces (albeit with perfect RSSI).  Such virtual
wireless interfaces will accept the same configuration commands as actual
radios, and I am curious if clever use of the loopback module, bridging, or
hwsim's monitoring netdev could even let one pass packets between separate
VMs.

Essentially DLEP is a new RFC draft which is being discussed at the IETF right now . It is a protocol between $radio and $routing_protocol
It can communicate two-way and send commands such as txpwr-- or txpwr++ or read out the SNR and things like that.
Essentially, it is the glue connecting a routing protocol 's metric calculation system with it's radios.
A txpower plugin would fit very neatly into this framework. Take a look at it: http://olsr.org/git/?p=dlep_app.git;a=summary

Hey Stas,

* Are there scientific papers about projects or ideas which involve
commotionwireless (as for the mesh building)?

As of right now there are no scientific papers that are ON commotion. 
But, there are many on the ideas and concepts that compose commotion. 
The first thing I would do it go to code.commotionwireless.net and 
check out the development notes section of the main commotion wireless 
project wiki. We throw a bunch of links and references to papers under 
various topics there.  You will want to search for byzantine style 
distributed networks for academic papers on the type of network 
Commotion is creating.

Keep in touch as you work on what exactly your focus is. I have a 
plethora of academic papers referenced in various files and folders.  
If you need any help refining your topic, finding the terms used by 
various fields, or tracking down quality research shoot me an e-mail. I 
have been collecting academic articles on our topics for quite a while.

* Does commotionwireless support secure routing or other secure 
mechanisms?

As of right now the two mechanisms we have implemented are WPA None and 
AuthSAE. Of course this upcoming 6 months to a year is when that will 
be changing quite a bit hopefully.

Let me know if you have any questions. Also, I would love if you would 
send me any interesting or informative articles you find as you do your 
research. I am always looking to find good resources.

We were having trouble building busybox, so I investigated the
busybox_config file. It looks like there is a hard-coded path set in
CONFIG_SYSROOT that prevents it from building when the NDK is not in a
particular location.

After I modified the CONFIG_SYSROOT value to reflect the location of the
system root in my NDK installation, everything worked fine. Is there a
way that I can make that variable dynamic? Or should I just add a note

I know that you're out of town, so I hate to bother you. I am trying to
work through the latest commits. It appears that the app ""does not work""
on any of the phones that we've tested here.

We are using the HTC Sensation 4G, the Virgin Mobile LG phone and
Andrew's Motorola Atrix device.

The most visible error that we see is that the app cannot connect to the
JsonInfo plugin on port 9090. This seems to be a red herring, though. On
the devices, the wifi never really seems to associate. Given the changes
that have been made to how you are now associating with access points, I
don't know what other helpful information to provide for your debugging.

If there are things that you want me to try, please let me know.
Otherwise, I will continue to debug on my own and sync up when you are

I know there was some expectation of perhaps Cyanogen 7 being the
firmware (though I did it seeing running on a rooted stock/AOSP Nexus
One), and that specifically the testing one our end has been limited to
HTC and Motorola.

Are any of these running CM7 or above?

Is the LG phone an Optimus? We have a Sprint/Ting CDMA LG Optimus that
perhaps we can start adding into our test kit.

What I think we recently discovered (and Hans will have to back me up or
correct me here) that while adhoc wireless is not supported in the
typical way (i.e. you can see the network and select it), you can
definitely insert and active configuration information for adhoc
networks via the WirelessManager API.

See the ""Ignore adhoc"" in the WirelessManager Android source (meaning,
they support them but just don't display them):
http://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/ext/com.google.android/android-apps/4.0.1_r1/com/android/settings/wifi/WifiSettings.java#506

and then our code here for manually configuring an adhoc network via the
public WirelessManager API:
https://code.commotionwireless.net/projects/commotion-android/repository/revisions/87466f5344fa36ff78333d58f14ab126b11fe41b/entry/src/net/commotionwireless/meshtether/MeshService.java#L334

This is all very new, and I am sure there are bugs, but I did see this
working live on a rooted stock/AOSP Nexus One late last week, so... ya.

No, and that's kind of what I was thinking. I thought that the new API that HC was using required CM. If it is the case that CM is required, it's personally not a big deal. I just wanted to confirm that before I spent time debugging. :-)

Yes, I believe that it is an Optimus: http://www.lg.com/us/cell-phones/lg-LS670-Gray-optimus-s Is that the one that you have? I will be online in irc tomorrow if we want to go over any of the other details.

Well, if you could have at least one Cyanogen handset around, that
probably would not hurt. I think we are still in a ""it works best on
Cyanogen"" state, though I am also fairly certain it is no longer required.

If you need us to express mail down a Nexus One with Cyanogen on it

Thanks for catching the busybox config issue, I think the thing to try is replace the /usr/local/android-ndk with $NDK_BASE, hopefully that will work.

Whenever you see the can't connect to 9090 error, that means that olsrd is not running. For some reason, the LD_LIBRARY_PATH stopped working for the plugin loading, I dont' know what.  But sticking the full path to the plugins in the olsrd.conf worked for me.  I just pushed that commit.

As for which distro, I think this should work on a lot of android distros.  I've been most recently developing on a Nexus One with the stock ROM.  But HTC+Cyanogenmod is the safest bet.

There is one other relevant outstanding issue: the routing.  The Android static IP API requires that a gateway is specified.  So we stuck in the phone's own IP for the gateway.  This means the default route is then the phones own IP.  I added busybox so we can easily delete that route, but I haven't found the right place in the whole startup operation to do this and actually have the setting stick.  It can be done manually and it works.

So this just means that an HNA that specifies a default route (0.0.0.0) won't work in the current app without manual intervention via the terminal.  Once we have Will's framework for starting and stopping lots of terminal command via a single 'su -c' thread, then we can clean up the whole startup process and make sure that route stays deleted.

Update: I flashed an HTC Sensation with CM 9 and the app now works ...
sort of. I occasionally (often, actually) have a problem where the app
gets stuck at ""Found active WAN interface"". When this happens it looks
like the run script doesn't even get to where olsrd is started. If this
is something you haven't seen, I am happy to debug. I just thought I'd
ask before I went down that path.

Thanks for your interest in the platform. Check out the file
busybox_config in the external/ directory. Look for a configuration
value named CONFIG_SYSROOT. Make sure that the value for this variable
is set to the actual location of your android NDK. For instance,
CONFIG_SYSROOT=""/home/hawkinsw/android-ndk-r8/platforms/android-8/arch-arm""

666,Commotion-dev, Community Wireless resources - what to do?,"Fri, 27 Jul 2012 11:35:44 -0400",-0400,Benjamin Chodoroff,"Hi commotioners,

Over here at the workdept, we're busy working on the knowledgebase
website - commotion's future home on the internet.

One of the features that the commotion community had in mind early on in
the planning process was to provide a general informational wiki-style
thing to keep track of community wireless and free software mesh
networking technology... not specifically limited to commotion, but
related in that commotion is one part of this larger ecosystem.

I'm excited to build this resource, mostly because i've wanted to share
my own notes and haven't had a place to do so. I think a lot of other
people are in the same boat.

If anyone has any thoughts or ideas about this part of the project,
let's talk about it.

A quick list of things that I think are important:

* while the rest of the commotion site will be related to the commotion
project, this ""community wireless resources"" section will contain
information related to core technologies and projects
* we should talk about the name -- i prefer ""community wireless"" or
""community internet"" since we might end up sharing information about
non-mesh or non-wireless tech
* i'd like to encourage people involved in other (potentially
similar-to-commotion) projects to participate in building this resources
section -- let's start developing a list of groups we should
specifically invite to talk about their project or provide info.
* the most exciting part of this resource section, to me, will be some
sort of list of prominent community networks -- this is the info that
i've had the hardest time finding on the web!

ok, enough from me for now!

I recently sent an email about encountering a build error (""<long ndk

change the CONFIG_SYSROOT to point to my ndk (which I had done) BUT I

it.  After doing that, everything built fine.

first thing: i've noticed that, at least on some ubuntu systems i use,
you need to specify an alias interface name when you start olsrd for it
to work.. like ``olsrd -i wlan0:0'' if your mesh interface is wlan0.
olsrd ends up using wlan0 and not using wlan0:0 -- it marks it as down.

second thing: when olsrd has an interface that is down, jsoninfo doesn't
deal with it gracefully - it segfaults!

i used httpinfo as an example and patched
lib/jsoninfo/src/olsrd_jsoninfo.c - jsoninfo checks to see if rifs

Ok, I finished all of the features for the first round of MeshTether and
its working pretty well on the Nexus One I'm using for testing.  I've
also tried the HTC Wildfire, Motorola Droid, and HTC myTouch 3G.

I've implemented the mesh profiles like this:

- (default) uses the wifi/ip settings from the preferences and the
  olsrd.conf that is included in the app

- the rest are scanned from the file system in two places:
    * in the app's app_bin/ folder
    * /mnt/sdcard/MeshTether

- the scanner looks in those dirs for *.properties and takes the
  filename as the profile name (i.e. myprofile.properties will be
  linked to the ""myprofile"" item in the profiles menu)

- if there is also a myprofile.conf next to the myprofile.properties
  then it will use that as the olsrd.conf. otherwise, it'll use the
  included olsrd.conf

- the properties options are:

    ssid=commotionwireless.net
    bssid=02:CA:FF:EE:BA:BE
    channel=5
    ip=172.29.0.0
    ipgenerate=true
    netmask=255.255.0.0
    dns=8.8.8.8

- all are required, except 'ipgenerate', which marks the 'ip' as the
  root for the IP generation algorithm.  If 'ipgenerate' is unset or
  not 'true', then the 'ip' is used as is.

Here's a test apk:

36x36, 48x48 and 96x96 at the supported resolutions

Below is the second iteration of the home page design, based on feedback from OTI. There are two files: one showing a drop-down menu on hover and one without.

The arrows on the navigation bar indicate that a drop-down menu is available on hover. We don't think these indicators are necessary but will certainly keep them if needed.

We revised the icons for Get Started and Get Involved that are consistent with the illustration style of Commotion's standard icons. We think that this consistency is important and would like to avoid introducing a new illustration style to the site.

Send any feedback you have to Seamus at OTI, who is coordinating the approval of the design.

Below is the second iteration of the home page design, based on feedback from OTI. There are two files: one showing a drop-down menu on hover and one without.

https://dl.dropbox.com/u/15155891/commotion_kb_rev1drop.pdf

The arrows on the navigation bar indicate that a drop-down menu is available on hover. We don't think these indicators are necessary but will certainly keep them if needed.

We revised the icons for Get Started and Get Involved that are consistent with the illustration style of Commotion's standard icons. We think that this consistency is important and would like to avoid introducing a new illustration style to the site.

Send any feedback you have to Seamus at OTI, who is coordinating the approval of the design.

Thanks!

I'm a fan of the mesh diagram in the icon, do you think you could make a thick-lined version for these tiny icons?  I think they could read similarly to the thin-lined big versions.

As for the on/off button, this new icon looks more like a button and seems to me well suited to represent the ""off"" state.  Do you think you could make an ""on"" version with the mesh lines or something like that?

This is great to hear about. We've been working on a client-node-client
websocket messaging (we affectionately refer to this as ""meshaging"")
server openwrt package over here in the work dept. We're tidying up some
intro docs that will be ready tomorrow and will have some beta code and
packages posted next week. If you're adventurous, you can try the code
at https://github.com/AdamMagaluk/commotion-ws-routing.git sans context
and testing ;)

Rather than ""supernodes"" we've been focusing on using the power of
whatever devices that connect to the AP to do any heavy lifting, and
using the nodes to simply pass messages / keep track of connected clients.

Is there discussion elsewhere related to registering ""apps"" with LuCI or
are we coming up with this stuff alone?

Is there another wiki page aside from ""Meshable applications"" to look over?

What other mesh-based applications and ideas have people come across?

It's up to you, really! I have no idea why Eclipse complains to me. It only occurs when I import the project into Eclipse. It doesn't cause any problems but annoys me nonetheless.

709,Commotion-dev, a bit about mesh apps,"Mon, 20 Aug 2012 09:27:45 -0400",-0400,Benjamin Chodoroff,"Hi list,

Over here in Detroit, we've been working on mesh applications. We'll be
pushing out some blog posts and code during this week. Please take a
look at my first draft of the first post below. I'll put it on the
internet more publicly later today!

Overview

Over the past few years, The Work Department has been active in building
community wireless networks in Detroit. We have experimented with
different types of hardware and software, and we have helped
neighborhoods build useful networks to share internet connectivity and
provide local file sharing. Something we haven?t had much of an
opportunity to explore, though, is building more elaborate systems that
leverage the unique traits of mesh networks.

As we worked through other parts of the Commotion project, we
brainstormed ideas for wireless mesh applications. We noticed that our
ideas would oftentimes replicate existing web services - e.g. a local
fileserver for music or movies, or a local message board for
neighborhood discussion. We began to wonder what would make a community
wireless application more appealing than using a centralized
Internet-based application. We agreed that it wouldn?t be enough to
offer someone the simple satisfaction of knowing their data is
decentralized... there would need to be some other benefits to using a
local application.

What would these benefits be? What is special about the architecture of
a community wireless mesh network? In pondering these questions, we
considered what is provided by these networks -- earlier, I mentioned
that the networks provide internet connection sharing and local file
sharing... but that?s only a part of the story. These networks also
provide something much grander: they become community institutions.
Unlike the Comcast hardware that is bolted out of arm?s reach on a
utility pole, our community wireless equipment lives on our porches, in
chicken coops, in our bell towers, and next to our desks. Each piece of
equipment has a story behind it. We know who held the ladder while it
was being installed and who lent their hammer drill to run a cable up to it.

A community mesh wireless router?s IP address is more than a 32 bit
number. It has history and meaning. How can we build applications that
reflect and enhance this?

I had the good fortune to meet Adam Magaluk at the Detroit?s
hackerspace, OmniCorpDetroit. Adam works on mesh wireless systems at
Illuminating Concepts, and is deeply interested in OLSR and embedded
systems. We are both young programmers, and share a desire for modular
and decentralized systems. During our initial conversations and
research, we ended up favoring web browser based application development
-- this way, people who might want to use an application wouldn?t have
to download anything. With today?s web browsers having lightweight
streaming messaging capabilities with WebSocket, we would have a lot of
flexibility in application development.

To build a web browser based application, we can start by limiting the
amount of work the server does to a bare minimum. In the circumstance of
a chat application, we can say that the server should simply keep a
record of who is connected to a chat session (in a sort of subscription
model) and then, as messages are posted, transfer messages from the
publisher to the subscribers.

Limiting the duties of each mesh node to passing messages and keeping
track of connected clients ends up being beneficial in two ways: it
conserves computing resources and encourages decentralized application
development. Since most community wireless routers are low power, low
cost devices running with MIPS CPUs and 4-16GB memory, the former
benefit is clearly attractive. The latter benefit is a bit more complex
- do we really need a fully decentralized application? Why can?t we just
have a little bit of local node storage? It sure would make things
simpler if we could have a local data cache instead of trying to develop
a peer-to-peer storage system.

To begin experimenting with the core concepts of lightweight messaging
systems that can work with hardware that makes up a community wireless
network, we built a system to provide WebSocket service to clients
connected to a Commotion access point. This service can be utilized by
anything on the network, but in our first example application, it is
employed by a web application served from a publicly-accessible LuCI
URL, linked from the splash page. The application provides a simple
interface to chat with other people who have connected to the local
node?s websocket chat system.

Thanks to Hans Christoph Steiner?s work on the jsoninfo plugin, OLSRd
can easily provide some useful network information as a json object to
web applications. Above the network layer, our websocket message server
can provide data about connected clients and possibly other information
in the future.

After you get your head wrapped around the WebSocket sever, its
underlying restrictions, and the mesh network playing field, you can
start to imagine various situations where local messaging might be
interesting. With an idea in mind, a developer can easily jump into a
familiar web application development environment - if you have used
WebSockets or socket.io or the like before, you understand the core
concepts of writing a mesh network application using these building
blocks. As we build more features into the platform, it will offer more
options for developers.

Next Steps

Currently, the system provides a messaging service that doesn?t utilize
node-to-node mesh connections. As it stands, we can develop some
interesting and useful applications, but there is definitely a lot to
gain from adding functionality as well as possibly revamping things in
the interest of security or privacy.

Our next major task is to begin experimenting with systems to allow
neighboring nodes to subscribe to each others? connections. To use the
chat application as an example of how this might be used, a chat
participant might be able to start a conversation with people connected
to their own mesh node as well as its next neighbors, or some other
arbitrary number of hops.

We would also like to experiment with simple implementations of shared /
distributed storage. Again, to use the chat system as an illustration,
we could have chat participants store chat logs and offer them to new
participants who broadcast a request for the last n minutes of
conversation. There is a lot of distributed storage work for us to
reference, of course, so we have our work cut out for us!

Aside from enhancements and features in the messaging system itself, we
have plenty of ideas for the actual applications. We have recently been
prototyping games that could use a neighborhood or multi-neighborhood
mesh network as a playing field. We have found that prototyping and
brainstorming games is an enlightening process: it helps explain the ins
and outs of the technology to people, and also presents clear challenges
to create obvious and attainable goals within the technology?s
limitations. We?ll be sharing some ?capture the flag? style game ideas
that utilize a meshaging system during the next couple of weeks.

Short answer: You're welcome to start talking about it and asking for input.

We here at OTI have been waiting for a couple of pieces to come together
before we really publicize it. First, we want to get Will's su component

715,Commotion-dev, MeshTether test release - olsrd for Android,"Wed, 22 Aug 2012 16:56:34 -0400",-0400,Hans-Christoph Steiner,"
Commotion MeshTether is an Android app that aims to make it possible to
connect to OLSR meshes with a single click of a button.  It comes
configured for the Commotion mesh by default, but can be entirely
configured, and can have multiple mesh ""profiles"" to choose from.

There are two information tabs: Links and Info.  Links shows all of the
first-hop links and Info shows the entire wifi config and olsrd.conf
settings.  Additionally, you can share/email debug information from the
app's menu.

Its working pretty well on the Nexus One I'm using for testing.  I've
also tried the HTC Wildfire, Motorola Droid, and HTC myTouch 3G.

The mesh profiles are implemented like this:

- (default) uses the wifi/ip settings from the preferences and the
  olsrd.conf that is included in the app

- the rest are scanned from the file system in two places:
    * in the app's app_bin/ folder
    * /mnt/sdcard/MeshTether (i.e. the MeshTether folder on the SD card)

- the scanner looks in those folders for *.properties files and takes
  the filename as the profile name (i.e. myprofile.properties will be
  linked to the ""myprofile"" item in the profiles menu)

- if there is also a myprofile.conf next to the myprofile.properties
  then it will use that as the olsrd.conf. otherwise, it'll use the
  included olsrd.conf

- the properties options are:

    ssid=commotionwireless.net
    bssid=02:CA:FF:EE:BA:BE
    channel=5
    ip=172.29.0.0
    ipgenerate=true
    netmask=255.255.0.0
    dns=8.8.8.8

- all are required, except 'ipgenerate', which marks the 'ip' as the
  root for the IP generation algorithm.  If 'ipgenerate' is unset or
  not 'true', then the 'ip' is used as is.

Here's a test apk:

717,Commotion-dev, OpenWRT trunk r33202 does PSK-encrypted adhoc on,"Thu, 23 Aug 2012 18:04:05 -0500",-0500,Ben West,"Hi All,

Sharing some results from a couple weeks of surfing the choppy waters
of recent OpenWRT trunk: I have been able to get 2 UBNT ar71xx nodes
to mesh with PSK-encrypted adhoc, aka IBSS RSN.

You can even configure the encryption in /etc/config/wireless,
provided you use hostapd and wpa_supplicant packages instead of wpad
or wpad-mini.

Known so far:
- The meshconfig tool bundled w/ Commotion does not work at all,
likely due to significant changes made after trunk r31639 for netifd
support.  I unfortunately could not glean more info about this, since
nodes flashed w/ the commotionbase package atop r33202 trunk became
completely unresponsive.  I have a TTL/serial cable on order, to
hopefully learn more about this.
- Likewise, the freifunk-watchdog service (ffwatchd), as configured &
bundled w/ Commotion, doesn't seem to like an encrypted mesh.  I saw
it repeatedly restarting the wireless interfaces, so I removed that
pkg from the firmware images I was testing with.  I posted a query to
this list previously if anyone knows of documentation available for
ffwatchd.
- Although you can indeed specify ""encryption psk"" for the mesh VAP in
/etc/config/wireless, a bug with wpa_supplicant.sh causes that VAP to
lose its assigned IP address thereafter.  I had do ""ifconfig wlan0
10.12.x.x"" after bringing up the wireless to restore the IP address.
- ""iw wlan0 station dump"" suggests that nodes joining an encrypted
mesh do not get reliably ""authorized,"" even when they are
""authenticated.""  On the un-authorized node where I observed this, I
bringing its wlan0 down and then back up resolved this.
- My UBNT nodes were able to ping each other (even at 10ms intervals
using fping) OK for days, until a power blip reset them.

Unknown, so far:
- Whether this works for ath5k too.  Trunk r33202 does not appear to
boot at all on ath5k, although recent patches submitted to trunk do
explicitly mention IBSS RSN support for ath5k.
- What sort of speed penalty this imposes, or if the PSK encryption is
done in hardware or software on either platform.
- Whether ar71xx/ath5k driver will let you add more VAPs (encrypted or
not) to a physical interface already broadcasting an encrypted mesh.
- Whether hostapd-mini and wpa-supplicant-mini will correctly
configure IBSS RSN, too.

It looks like much thanks for getting IBSS RSN to a functional state
on Atheros chips should go to Antonio Quartulli, who is involved with
the BATMAN-based project http://open-mesh.org.

I removed it.  Turns out I think I was wrong about where it came from.
I think it came from the Barnacle author.  I looked at other Android

it was inserted by an SVN plugin or something.

The much-talked-about single SU functionality is ready to deploy. Most
of the functionality works through a daemon known as fork. fork is a
shell that allows ""the user to remotely start a shell, manage jobs, and
give input and take output from those jobs"". For more information about
fork, please refer to the project README file available at
https://github.com/opentechinstitute/shell-fork.

fork has a Java API that is used to incorporate it into the MeshTether
application. The Java API has JavaDoc to explain its usage. To ""make""
the JavaDoc, use the ant target javadoc, as in
$ ant javadoc
The resulting files will be in the bin/ directory of the source code tree.

Attached to this email are the patches to the MeshTether application
that integrate fork. The patches include changes to Java source code and
Makefiles.

In order for these patches to work, you must first incorporate
shell-fork (git://github.com/opentechinstitute/shell-fork.git) as a
submodule in the external/fork path.

I'm sure that there are parts of the integration that I am forgetting to
mention. Please send email and we can hash things out.

For now, just submit a patch to the commotion-dev list. We've been
talking about this sort of project governance issue, and have a few
ideas on privilege escalation, but we haven't nailed down any of the
processes.

Once we put up the new Commotion site (sometime in the next couple of
weeks) and have something public to point to, we will start having these
discussions more publicly. In the mean time, please feel free to share
any ideas. We're not trying to shut people out or reinvent the wheel.

Does not require it, as far as I know. I only put in 16 as the default
because it's the SDK platform that I have installed on my machine. The
gist of what's going on there is this:

The MeshTether app wants to be notified using an Android Handler object.
To include the ability for the fork Java API to include this
functionality and build properly, it has to ""link"" against android.jar.
(At least that's the way I understand it.) So, as a default I used what
I had defined on my system and that was 16. The Android Handler has been
in the API since version 1
(http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Handler.html) so it
should work on any platform.

I hope I made that clearer rather than, well, vaguer, if that's even a word.

> 
> - Does fork not work with the wifiLock?  It was commented out in

That was only commented out because it does not work on the specific
device that I am using for testing. Sorry for allowing that to slip through.

Please reach out with other questions. I am interested in your feedback,
as always!

Would it be possible to start 'fork' in a Java Thread, then interact

session key came about because I was not interacting with fork through

Obviously the goal is not to have a remote shell over the network so
TCP/IP isn't a design requirement.

If there is an interest in moving toward this model, just let me know. I

Josh, Andrew and I discussed this further offline. We talked about
making this change to interact with fork via stdio in a future release.

I talked about the rationale of using TCP/IP and session keys in the
first place (debugging convenience, asynchronicity of issuing
control/input commands) and the reason why it's not a big deal to switch
over. That said, staying with TCP/IP at this point seems like a good
idea to us so that we can have a fixed debugging target while fork is
integrated with MeshTether. As far as I can tell, the change to this
model of interaction between user and fork would not significantly
change the API.

I think your approach has a lot of potential for streamlining the
handling of root in Android apps.  I'm still trying to wrap my head
around it, so that's where a lot of my questions come from.  Then I'm a
bit dogmatic when it comes to ""as simple as possible"".

Will, could you reissue your patches without the API change and removal
of the wifi lock?  Or if the wifi lock is an issue, that should probably
be handled separately.  Also as a stylistic thing, I think there is no
need to leave in commented out code, since that code will always be in
the git history.  But others disagree on that one.

Here is a repackage of those patches w/out the commented out wifi lock
code. I tend to agree that removing code outright is the best,
especially when everything is under revision control. When I look back
at blocks of code that is commented out I always wonder if I left it
there with intent to put it back in later! It's so much clearer when
it's just gone.

Let me know if you need other modifications to these patches.

does successfully mesh with the existing two UBNT ar71xx nodes.  So,
encrypted mesh does work for atheros and ar71xx targets on OpenWRT trunk
r33202.

I've been letting all 3 nodes mutually fping each other as fast as they
will allow (roughly 1 ping per 50ms) for the past several days.  So for no
lockups or ugly complaints appearing in kernel logs, despite ifconfig
reporting multiple GBytes transferred.

The problem with ath5k images not booting is actually due to a recently
introduced compile option mucking with older ath5k devices:

only you can reach since its an ssh connection using the account

My own naive Googling suggests one is quite capable of getting Android up

Ice Cream Sandwich v4.0:

It looks like Android x86 is a popular source, but I am curious to hear

Why not just download the Android SDK, which comes with the Android
emulator, which is just a thin wrapper of QEMU.  There are ARM and x86

I'd side with hc on this one. Unless there is a specific reason for

My guess is yes, tho I have not specifically tried.  In terms of
inter-VM communications, olsrd should only need proper TCP/IP, which VMs

Hey Teco,

For the first phase of MeshTether dev, we worked on getting it fully
working working on some devices.  I worked with HTC devices and a
Motorola Droid/Milestone, and those all work every time for me now.  The
next phase of the development will focus on getting it working on as
many devices as possible.

The next step to getting the Wolfgang AT-AS28D working is figuring out
first what the problem is.  You can get a lot of info from the Info tab.
 The easiest way to check whether adhoc got setup correctly is to
compare the ""wifi settings"".  The first block of settings is what the
app is trying to set, the second block is what was read from the wifi
driver.  If they are not the same, that means adhoc setup failed.

Which BSSID field is numeric only?  I can type numbers and letters into
the BSSID field in the Settings just fine on my phone.

Or joining the network failed. It sends beacons with something that looks OK. Maybe if stayed down, because there is no peer station.
I'll test more, with focus on the beacon and probe messages. It looks like wrong formatted and ignored by my other nodes. 

Can I assume you tested with phones and OpenWRT boxes?

I used cut&paste.
I have a numeric keyboard, with greyed alfa (ABC on 2, DEF on 3, etc).
I can use some special characters, for dailing.

This sounds like my experience on Samsung devices as well.  I think
it'll take some digging to iron that process out.

This is odd, so you are seeing something like the first screen here,
where the BSSID and IP are set successfully in the ""wifi info"" section:
https://code.commotionwireless.net/projects/commotion/wiki/Android_Troubleshooting

You should be able to get the olsrd.log, which should tell you why olsrd
didn't start up.

I was using a Nexus One with a stock firmware as my main testing device,
so stock should be OK.  But stock varies depending on the vendor.  I
think the Nexus One has a bcm4329 also.

adhoc mode != AHDEMO.
I used AHDEMO with madwifi, but I had to switch to IBSS when I switched to ath5k. For a mesh/manet, AHDEMO can have less problems because there are no 802.11 management frames. But it only works when wlan stack does support it, and needs configured BSSID and channel.
I think AHDEMO drains the battery less fast as WiFi-Direct or IBSS, depending on the MANET protocol and timers. But no power saving mode.

To use AHDEMO mode, wouldn't every single device on the mesh have to use it?  Could you have some using IBSS and others using AHDEMO at the same time?  AHDEMO sounds great, but such limitations of compatibility limit its usefulness to our goals for MeshTether, which is people easily setting up their own impromptu meshes.  AHDEMO mode sounds great for a backhaul mesh, but the Commotion project uses OpenWRT for that.

If you wanted to add AHDEMO support to MeshTether, I think we could incorporate it into the app.

Good point.  In terms of ""can't work in contention"", it should be able to work on some level with contention, no?  If an AHDEMO packet collides with a packet from some other wifi, shouldn't it retry?  For sure, it'll perform poorly, but it should work somewhat unless there is heavy contention.

775,Commotion-dev, Commotion Android UI Testing,"Wed, 26 Sep 2012 16:00:59 -0400",-0400,Andrew Reynolds,"Hi all,

We're beginning some user testing of the Commotion Android client in
preparation for a round of UI refinement.

I've thrown a draft script of the test procedures up on the wiki, as
well as a short user survey to help categorize users by level of expertise.

The script assumes Commotion will be preinstalled and will connect to an
existing Commotion network. The user will perform a few tasks using the
network (a Cryptocat chat in this case, though other apps would be fine)
and talk about their experience.

The survey focuses solely on Android expertise, but it's designed to be
modular, so it could easily be augmented with questions about networking
expertise or specific usage patterns.

The script is here:
https://code.commotionwireless.net/projects/commotion/wiki/Commotion-Android_v1_Script
and it links to the survey, which is here:

Yeah, I've been struggling with that question. The problem is that to a
lot of people, the network is just a utility. Without a specific
interest in network diagnostics, I suspect most folks would turn it on,
say ""Yep! It's meshing!"" and leave it at that.

The use case I went with when I wrote the question was a person who
would connect to the commotion mesh and leave it running mostly in the
background. I want them to be able to ignore it when they want to, but
still be able to find useful information when they need it.

I'm open to alternate tasks.

>   * Is the app going to be called Commotion or MeshTether?

There was a thread about that a while back. For what it's worth, I
always look for it under Commotion, not MeshTether.

Good point. I had figured on fleshing it out a bit before the Summit,
but I think the presenter could vary the details depending on the user.

The first question seems too broad to stand on its own. It's probably
more useful in the context of the second question.

I think user-friendliness on a scale of 1-5 is pretty ambiguous.

Dan's comments are good.  For me, personally, it's hard to understand how
much we want to, or need to, ""make of"" the mesh network.  Sometime down the
road, we hope it will be ""invisible"" like WiFi, but for not it's key that
we develop and understanding of how it actually works on mobile devices,
and if users are able to understand its basic properties and failure modes.
 Therefore, in the current testing, the network IS prominent.  Perhaps your

Overall, I think it looks good, and I'm excited to hear about the
results.  To follow up on Dave's comments, I think it would be good to
add more tests to it, something along the lines of:

* can the user just start meshtether, and click the ""go"" button, and
start using the mesh?
* how confusing is the long startup time? (I guess I assume its a bit
confusing and could be better represented).
* how can the user determine if the mesh is not working?
* what kind of things do they try to do if the mesh isn't working?
* how does the user try troubleshooting?

Sure. I see these as an extension of the mesh startup task. It's exactly
the kind of thing I was thinking of when I mentioned having the user
think out loud, but definitely worth adding to the list of questions if
only to confirm.

Any thoughts on how to do this in a scripted environment without making
the procedure too cumbersome?

Maybe stocking two phones, one working and one slightly misconfigured?

I've been working to get olsrd to pass the Debian 'hardening-check' and
incorporate all of the changes into the official Debian package.  I have
a test version that is working for me.  Now I'd love for others to test it.

There are two way to get the packages, the Guardian Project Commotion PPA:

  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:guardianproject/commotion
or
  https://launchpad.net/~guardianproject/+archive/ppa

And the Debian experimental package:

  http://packages.debian.org/experimental/olsrd

Since olsrd runs as root, its important that it is secure and hard to
exploit.  This is especially important as people install olsrd on
their own laptops and Android phones, where all sorts of sensitive data
is stored.

The first thing is just to make sure it works properly with any
configurations that you normally use.  Then, depending on any other
skills you might have, it would be awesome if someone tried to break it
and let us know what the exploits are. :-D

I was experimenting with building and installing the Commotion Android
application from the instructions in the
readme<https://code.commotionwireless.net/projects/commotion-android/repository/revisions/master/entry/README>.
I hit a few obstacles and had a few questions:

1. Initially the make build for the Android app was failing. I eventually
realized that the Makefile conditionally assigns 9 as the Android SDK
platform in line 11: SDK_PLATFORM_LEVEL ?= 9. From what I read 9 is
obsolete. The build ran sucessfully with platform level 16. Which SDK API
Level should I be using?

2. I had to explore quite a bit of the Android Developers documentation to
fill in the gaps of the Readme instructions. Including setting up device
detecting on Ubuntu<http://developer.android.com/tools/device.html#setting-up>.
Are there other Commotion Android resources (besides the readme) that
provide instructions on testing or troubleshooting?

3. After installing the app on two HTC mobile devices, we tested them and
they are either crashing or not fully functional. What is the best way for
me to debug this? Should I run the app with adb logcat and share my
findings on this commotion-dev? Is the commotion-android listserv not in

Either should be fine.  Originally Android build systems seemed to work best if you put the oldest supported version in that field.  Now they seemed to have changed their minds and say you should put the newest supported version.  If you want to compiled for android-9, you just have to install the android-9 stuff in the android updater.

The README assumes that you have a fully working Android development setup.  Otherwise we'd have to maintain a duplicate set of instructions as Google's.

Post here on commotion-dev.  I'm the main author of the Commotion MeshTether, and that's the first I've heard of the commotion-android list :)

The crashes should give you a stacktrace in logcat, that's a good place to start.  Post anything here that you want to discuss.

Right now the known working devices are HTC running Android 2.x some random others.  It works on my Motorola Droid running CyanogenMod, and I can sometimes get it working on my Samsung Galaxy Player 5.0 running 2.3.3.  Will is currently working on 4.x support.

Yes, level 9 is obsolete. We stuck with that one initially since it is
compatible some of the older phones running older releases of the
Android OS that we are targeting. As long as you are building with an
SDK/NDK that is compatible with the platform on which you are going to
deploy then you'll be fine! You can override the SDK_PLATFORM_LEVEL from
the command line by adding SDK_PLATFORM_LEVEL=16, for example, to any of
the make commands from the README. It's a shortcut for having to edit
the Makefile. The same trick applies for overriding the
NDK_PLATFORM_VARIABLE.

We do not yet have any of that type of documentation. We do have some
instructions on our internal wiki that document how to setup the Android
development environment under Ubuntu but we have not yet published that
externally. Do you think that's something that would help developers? If
so, we could move that from our internal wiki to the public wiki.

This is absolutely the place for that debugging. Please send along your
logcat output and we will start the debugging process. I'm sorry to hear
that you are having trouble. There are two possible explanations for the
failure: 1) you've found a bug in our application or 2) the phone that
you are using has a wifi chipset that is incompatible with adhoc mode.
In either case, having that logcat output will get us going in the right
direction!

Thanks for taking the time to write out your experiences. I look forward
to hearing back from you and taking this conversation forward.

Yes, they both require root to set adhoc because you need root to set the wireless settings.  But this is not a big deal since any app that I know that uses adhoc needs root for other things as well.  OLSR mesh and tethering apps need root for setting routes, fr example.

Anyone find any apks for this?  It looks like a pain to build.  I did a quick poke around the sources.  Looks like some useful stuff, with some overlap with the MeshTether code. Here's an overview of the pieces:

This only has some stuff related to building custom kernels for two Android devices:
https://github.com/monk-dot/SPAN.git

This looks like a modified version of olsrd based on olsrd at roughly commit 300e8ac364bbea7b9571ba938f893985416a16f9:
https://github.com/ProjectSPAN/android-manet-olsrd

This looks like an Android app written in Processing for visualizing the network:
https://github.com/ProjectSPAN/android-manet-visualizer

This seems to be the app wrapper for starting/stopping the mesh.
https://github.com/ProjectSPAN/android-manet-manager


Too bad they didn't post this code three months ago when they wrote it, it seems it just was posted on Oct 8th.  It would have been quite useful in the MeshTether app... they actually wrote a whole scraper for the txtinfo plugin, which sounds painful to me ;)

I haven't heard any ""nuclear"" problems with MeshTether or Barnacle (where MeshTether gets part of its adhoc logic from), but that's not saying it might not happen in the future :)

The meltdown occurred on my Motorola Droid running CM7 using Serval, which uses a different adhoc wrangling technique than MeshTether/Barnacle.  MeshTether is working fine on the Motorola Droid running CM7.    But MeshTether/Barnacle seem to support fewer devices currently than Serval.

Hey there,

I just saw that you posted the SPAN sources, thanks to Teco Boot's post to the olsr-dev list.  It looks like there is a lot of overlap between the SPAN project, and the Commotion project, specifically olsrd on Android, and its issues.  We're also working with Serval as well and are looking to get some more code sharing going on.  To start with, an android ad-hoc framework to encapsulate all the tricks needed to enable adhoc mode for various devices.

If you're interested in trying the Commotion MeshTether app, you can get a test build here:
https://commotionwireless.net/blog/meshtether-test-release

and the source is here:
https://code.commotionwireless.net/projects/commotion-android

In related news, you'll probably be happy to hear that we've been working with some Google engineers on their 20% time to get adhoc support into Android.  The patch is been submitted to the Android gerrit, has been verified by their automated builder, and is just waiting for final approval from the Android dev:

I wasn't involved in the choice of olsrd for Commotion, but I can throw my own opinion in :

olsrd was created in 2004, so its hardly reinventing the wheel.  olsrd is what runs large (1000 node) meshes in places like Vienna with funkfeuer, and a lot of other cities.

Can you expand more on the meshing that you worked on?  We're always interested in hearing more real world experience.  How would you make meshing work on phones without using adhoc mode wifi?

Another thing to add that we have working in MeshTether is the WifiConfig in Android space so that Android thinks it has a network connection, instead of telling Android that wifi is disabled.

As an aside, how would you run OLSR or BATMAN without root?

824,Commotion-dev, SPAN Android App,"Mon, 15 Oct 2012 17:34:03 +0000",+0000,"Robble, Jeff","Hi Hans,

What Android devices does Commotion currently support? I tried it out an my Galaxy Nexus (CDMA) and Galaxy S II (SPH-D710) to no avail.

Supporting all of the various Android devices and their hardware differences is a major issue. A common framework would be great. Currently SPAN works on devices with Wireless Extensions kernel support. That way we can simply use iwconfig; however, there are some things that iwconfig can't seem to do on Android devices, like set the 802.11 channel.

It seems that Commotion is focusing on OLSR. Is there a reason you went with OLSR and not BATMAN? Serval uses BATMAN I believe. Based on what I read, the main developers behind OLSR came up with BATMAN to address circular routing, network congestion, and performance issues. Yet, OLSR-NG apparently fixed their fisheye feature and now it performs much better than before with less network congestion: http://www.olsr.org/?q=node/13

Ultimately a generic framework for plug-and-play routing protocols would be best. That way people could test and determine which ones are best. Have you guys given any thought to reactive protocols (like AODV) vs. proactive protocols (like OLSR)?

Serval does a decent job with security; however, it seems that for each device they randomly generate a public/private key pair such that the public key is an IPv4 address they statically assign to that device. While the probability is low that there will be IPv4 address collision in a class C subnet, there is still a possibility, and that doesn't sit right with me. SPAN is looking into using tinc (http://www.tinc-vpn.org/) for P2P VPN across the mesh and sharing keys via NFC.

SPAN is also looking into supporting iOS. Have the Commotion folks looked into that yet?

Getting ad-hoc support into the Android framework would be amazing. The root requirement is a no-go for a lot of users. Also, it would be great if an Android app. could simply work over the mesh without needing to be customized against a special mesh API. That's why SPAN came up with a transparent proxy that runs on the device and routes outgoing packets to our mesh service. Of course apps will need an API to get the peer list, etc., but existing ""stock"" Android apps wouldn't need to change.

I've looked into Wifi Direct a little bit.  From what I've seen, its not a replacement for adhoc mode unless you want to use Wifi Direct meshing.  Wifi Direct meshing is limited to 32 nodes in the spec.  So if you're happy with all meshes always under 32 nodes, then it could work well.

I will defer to Josh, one of the original Commotion designers who was
one of those people who helped make the decision to focus on OLSRd.
However, I can say that one of our goals for the near future is to
support multiple routing protocols (and even perhaps supporting
802.11s). We have looked into BATMAN and that is on our short list of

It sounds like what you are describing is similar to their mesh datagram
protocol. Commotion is actively working with Serval to implement MDP
into its implementation. Is this what you are describing?

We have ""looked"" into it but not yet gotten very far. We have iOS
development expertise in house (me) but have not yet moved forward. If
you have an architecture in mind I would like to hear about it. If not,
I would absolutely be interested in brainstorming approaches to mesh
networking in iOS.

I would be interested in hearing more about this. With the Commotion
Mesh Tether application running on a mesh network with access to the
Internet (through HNA), applications ""just work"". For instance, I can
fire up the default Android web browser and hop on the Internet without
needing to know that I am reaching, for example, cnn.com over the mesh.
Is there a particular problem you were seeing that caused you to
implement this proxy solution?

There's a good reason that doesn't sit right, because we aren't doing
that at all. Sure we assign a random IPv4 address, but that has
nothing to do with our security layer. Note that the following
description refers to the upcoming 0.90 version, version 0.08 just
uses BATMAN or olsr with unencrypted network packets.

We're generating 256-bit ECC key pairs and using those as network
addresses. That doesn't mean we're putting public keys in standard IP
headers. We've basically written an entire network stack in user-space
with our own payload forwarding protocol that we encapsulate into
IP/UPD packets. And send them between instances of our servald daemon,
acting as routers.

When you send a payload via MDP, you address it to a 256-bit public
key and hand it over to your local servald daemon. This daemon
encrypts the payload, adds it to a queue, works out which neighbour to
use as the next hop, then stuffs a number of small payloads going to
the same broadcast/unicast address into an IP/UDP packet to reach that
neighbour.

In that respect, MDP behaves more like a many-to-many VPN that doesn't
(yet) have a tap/tun virtual interface.

Note that I've also done some work recently to support a small number
of servald daemon's operating on a larger olsr network. Essentially we
have a mode where servald will send mesh-wide flood messages, like
phone number lookup requests, via an olsr plugin. Servald will use
receipt of those messages to discover the unicast addresses of other
servald nodes on the network. From then on we can send encrypted
payloads, like phone number / public key responses or voice call
payloads, directly across the mesh.

I'm also extending the work I did for olsr, supporting unicast
destinations in servald's routing table, to build Serval's first piece
of infrastructure. An opt-in dns like global directory of phone
numbers, public keys, and current internet addresses. Some time in the
future, you will be able to use Serval to place phone calls over the
internet, or send any other kind of encrypted payload to anyone in the
world. And all you'll need to know is their phone number or public
key.

A picture is worth a thousand words... The logical structure of our
transmitted IP packets look something like this;

[ethernet header; source MAC, dest MAC, ...]
[ip / udp header; source IP, dest IP, source port, dest port, ...]
[serval packet format version number]
[transmitting device PK]
[payload list;
  [payload;
    - original source PK
    - final destination PK or broadcast identifier for de-duplication
    - next hop PK
    - payload length
    - payload body
  ],
  ...
]

Though the wire format does have some space saving tricks for sending
short abbreviations for PK addresses that are already known by both
parties.

When we receive a packet, we only use the source IP address to work
out where to send unicast reply packets destined for the ""transmitting
device PK"". And only if we're running in olsr mode or the transmitter
is in a different network sub-net.

We then look through the payload list for anything addressed to us as
the destination or next hop address, and process and/or forward them.

So yes, the network discovers public keys as it builds the routing
table and communicates with other devices. So we can easily encrypt
any packet with a PK destination over the network. But that doesn't
mean we've authenticated anyone's identity or done anything to detect
a man-in-the-middle attack.

Public key verification is still best done in person. Though we are
also looking at verification via an audio channel; relying on your
brain's ability to do voice print verification of identity, while
confirming the fingerprint of a shared secret.

Eventually we may also implement key signing for building a web of trust.

We may charge a token fee for registration, probably similar to the
cost of a dns name. Or we could charge for an identity verification
process where we send you a text message to confirm your control of a
phone number. Either of these approaches should help to dampen the
potential impact of spamming the phone number directory.

Though the technical details of the implementation are still up in the
air. I have thought about publishing phone number mappings via a hash
of the number and the current time to the nearest 12 hours or so. The
back end storage system then doesn't have the time to keep rebuilding
rainbow tables in order to work out what phone numbers have been
published.

Without any form of verification, you have to assume anyone could be
snooping via a man-in-the-middle attack. If you're happy to
communicate, knowing that a government or other attacker could be
listening, we're not going to stop you. Our current plan is to play a
beep periodically during a voice call, to indicate that the channel's
security has not been confirmed and might be recorded.

Once you've verified keys with someone, we expect you to initiate
communications using the keys themselves, without repeating the phone
number lookup.

So you're randomly generating a 256-bit key pair and using the public key

encapsulates it in a IP/UDP packet. Am I misunderstanding?

if you are wanting to throttle at rates above 10Mbit/s.

In effect, you can specify for qos-scripts maximum upload and download
bandwidth caps per interface.  However, you may need to do some testing to
determine which context for ""upload"" and ""download"" is assumed by
qos-scripts on each radio.  I.e., I believe it is different for gateway vs.

definitions (bulk, normal, express), to let you prioritize certain types of

very much myself.

You can look /etc/config/qos (if you have qos-scripts package installed)

please be aware that enabling QoS under certain conditions, especially

The bleeding-edge versions of OpenWRT, altho not yet Commotion, are now
using a bufferbloat fix called ""CoDel,"" but I've yet to try it out myself.

We prefer to send broadcast packets so we can include payloads for
multiple neighbours in the same frame, and it more closely matches
what's happening at the physical layer. We will need to fall back to
unicast packets if our neighbour can't hear our own broadcast packets.
Many android devices filter broadcasts when entering a low power
state, and some filter broadcasts all the time.

Though broadcast packets are more unreliable on ad-hoc wifi, if
there's a collision or interference the packet will be lost. While the
wifi layer will ack / nack unciast packets and will retry a few times
until successful, we've found a couple of devices like Samsung G SII
that retry so much in burst mode they consume all available bandwidth
for ~0.9 seconds.

Since we're expecting to route packets over a mesh, if a transmission
fails it may indicate that the topology has changed and any retry may
need to take a different path. Though we haven't implemented retries
at the network level yet.

If we're running in our new experimental olsr mode, we don't actively
try to determine the topology of the mesh at all, that's olsr's job.
We use a similar payload header for messages we send via olsr's
flooding service, and we establish a routing table entry mapping PK to
IPv4 address. Then we always send unicast IP packets directly to the
final destination. This has a lot in common with our approach for
routing payloads via the internet.

Since we can run a network in either mode, we should be able to easily
compare our routing engine to olsr to compare performance. I'm not
expecting us to beat olsr yet, we've still got a lot of work to do.
But if we get close, we should be able to prove it.

While serval does support devices with multiple interfaces, we haven't
tackled use cases where those interfaces use different modes of
routing. Either all devices should be in olsr mode, or all devices
should be routing via our protocol.

weaknesses of the md5 algorithm (which may or may not be relevant here),

servers to retrieve and verify the PGP signing key, instead of getting
it from our website.  Of course, this brings up the question of who
would own and manage the signing key for Commotion...

Finally, attached is a screenshot of a Downloads page for the Commotion
website I'm putting together.  Right now it just has OpenWRT, but
Android will also be added.  If anyone has suggestions for what else
should go on the page or what should be different, please let me know. 
Here (or maybe elsewhere?) we could also list the features that are in
development or planned, but aren't a part of the core Commotion
repositories (like OLSRd plugins), and there would be links out to these
sub-projects.

This is a good idea for sure.  One thing would be to use SHA1 instead of MD5.
 Its only a little longer and still not cracked.  A PGP signature is good for
people who actually check these things.  For the PGP sig to be effective, the
downloads should be signed by a key that is signed by as many other keys as
possible so that people can find a chain of trust to that key.

For most people, they'll never check a hash or a signature.  One thing that is
not hard to setup and transparent to the user is to force HTTPS for the
downloads, and have a real, valid cert.

About the download page layout, I think that next to the binaries, there
should be the source code.  I don't think having olsrd plugins there would be
useful since as far as I know they are all distributed as part of olsrd
itself, and never outside of it.

The website and downloads are all forced HTTPS, using a valid cert (at

a recommendation for the release task list: publish checksums and sigs 
in more than one place, and link to these other sources in release 
announcements+download page - if someone can modify the tarball, they 
can probably also modify the checksum on the website :)

853,Commotion-dev, NetworKManager: the good news and the bad news,"Wed, 24 Oct 2012 17:47:24 -0400",-0400,Hans-Christoph Steiner,"The good news is that one of the main devs was already thinking about a full
on plugin system for networkmanager that will make it full possible to support
all known OLSR configs.  The bad news is it doesn't exist yet... and the only
existing plugin interface is the VPN plugins.  That VPN plugin API is
basically useless to us since it assumes the IP layer, i.e. the wifi, is
already configured, and therefore provides no way to configure the wifi.

Here's the IRC transcript from my discusion dcbw aka Dan Williams aka Mr
Network Manager on the NetworkManager room (irc://irc.freenode.net/nm


(03:52:10 PM) _hc: hey all, I'm working on making OLSR mesh networking really
easy to do, and currently I'm focused on NM integration.  I don't have access
to an OLPC, so I can't try that stuff in NM.  So I wanted to ask here to get
some ideas for the right approach for me to take
(03:52:46 PM) _hc: the way I currently envision it is that you could browse
thru all adhoc wifi, then try to connect using OLSR
(03:53:04 PM) _hc: we're working on ways to detech OLSR meshes better, but
that'll come later
(03:53:48 PM) _hc: so there would be a separate listing, list ""Wired
Networks"", ""Wireless Networks"", ""OLSR Networks""
(03:54:04 PM) dcbw: _hc: ideally we can find the OLSR networks via beacon IEs
(03:54:35 PM) dcbw: _hc: the OLPC stuff is quite OLPC specific and only works
with the mesh implementation done for those devices
(03:54:54 PM) dcbw: _hc: which means, basically, a specific SSID is used that
indicates that the adhoc SSID is part of the OLCP mesh
(03:54:55 PM) _hc: then the use just needs to click on one of the networks,
then entire a WPA password if needed, do IP inof, etc
15:55
(03:55:10 PM) _hc: right, I konw the OLPC mesh is incompatible
(03:55:23 PM) _hc: but I was looking at it for an example of nm integration
(03:55:53 PM) _hc: our plan is to try to work out a similar SSID encoding for
OLSR networks
(03:56:12 PM) dcbw: _hc: kinda evil, ideally it would be a beacon IE but with
adhoc that's somewhat tricky
(03:56:14 PM) _hc: dcbw: what's a beacon IE?
(03:56:19 PM) dcbw: _hc: any reason it can't be 802.11s?
(03:56:30 PM) _hc: isn't 802.11s limited to 32 nodes?
(03:56:35 PM) dcbw: _hc: an Information Element
(03:56:50 PM) _hc: we're aiming for meshes of hundreds and thousands
(03:56:52 PM) dcbw: a TLV broadcast in the beacon for a specific type of
information
(03:57:06 PM) _hc: there are a number of long standing big OLSR meshes like that
(03:57:13 PM) dcbw: which could be a way to identify the network independent
of SSID
(03:57:50 PM) dcbw: _hc: sounds a lot like what we were trying to do with OLPC
5 years ago
(03:58:03 PM) dcbw: which *kinda* worked, hopefully things have gotten better
with large meshes since then :)
(03:58:22 PM) _hc: yeah, figures, that stuff is coming later, right now we
just want a list of adhoc networks that the use can guess based on SSID
(03:58:43 PM) _hc: dcbw: do you know the funkfeuer, freifunk, and related
projects?
(03:58:58 PM) dcbw: _hc: so if there's a specific SSID that identifies the
OLSR network, why would we need a separate section?  or is the SSID supposed
to be configurable?
(03:59:51 PM) _hc: so you're saying the OLSR mesh would just show up under
""Wireless Networks"" and if it received the right beacon IP or TLV, it would be
configured for OLSR?
16:00
(04:00:27 PM) _hc: that would be very nice, too bad the ID work is not there
yet, that's led by someone else, not me
(04:00:27 PM) dcbw: not quite
(04:00:52 PM) dcbw: what I'm saying is that it would be really, really nice
from NM's point of view to know which scanned SSIDs were OLSR capable
(04:01:12 PM) dcbw: so that we can do something intelligent in the UI instead
of saying ""hey, this coiuld be OLSR, but it migth not be, so I guess you have
to try connecting and if it's not OLSR it'll fail""
(04:01:38 PM) _hc: one sure fire way is to connect to the olsrd's UDP port
(04:01:49 PM) dcbw: yeah, but then you ahve to already be associated with the
network
(04:01:52 PM) _hc: but that comes later in the process, it would need to
associate, get an ip etc.
(04:01:53 PM) dcbw: so that's not going to work
(04:02:05 PM) _hc: yes, its the ""better than nothing"" solution
(04:02:07 PM) dcbw: ok
(04:02:15 PM) dcbw: OLSR is a routing protocol really, right?
(04:02:28 PM) _hc: kind of
(04:02:32 PM) dcbw: and it just runs on top of wifi adhoc or master-mode
networking?
(04:02:40 PM) _hc: right, adhoc
(04:02:52 PM) dcbw: ok, so any adhoc network can theoretically run OLSR
(04:02:59 PM) _hc: so yeah, you can think of olsrd as a routing daemon since
the IP effect is to change the routing table
(04:03:02 PM) dcbw: even in parallel with regular local network IP
(04:03:12 PM) _hc: hmm kind of, not really
(04:03:19 PM) _hc: olsrd will change the routing table
(04:03:28 PM) dcbw: ok, so IP addressing is done how?
(04:03:29 PM) _hc: but it'll keep the default route, I suppose
(04:03:31 PM) dcbw: link-local?
(04:03:44 PM) _hc: no, random number in a pre-assigned range
(04:03:53 PM) dcbw: how are collisions handled?
(04:03:58 PM) _hc: luck
(04:04:00 PM) _hc: hehe
(04:04:03 PM) _hc: big range
(04:04:05 PM) dcbw: ummm..... :)
(04:04:13 PM) _hc: yeah... that's in the works
(04:04:26 PM) _hc: there are a number of approaches for that, ahcpd is one
(04:04:27 PM) dcbw: ok, so you attempt to join the adhoc network and then you
assign yourself a random number in say the 10.x or 172.16.x range?
(04:04:31 PM) _hc: right
(04:04:40 PM) dcbw: and then you start up OLSR and hope somebody else you can
talk to is running it?
(04:04:48 PM) _hc: yup
16:05
(04:05:22 PM) _hc: you can think of an OLSR mesh as defined by a BSSID and a
channel
(04:05:34 PM) _hc: the SSID and IP range are basically part of that too, but a
little bit optional
(04:06:20 PM) _hc: I guess I should say: OLSR mesh is BSSID, channel, and OLSR
conf
(04:06:37 PM) dcbw: ok, so the core UI question is how is the user supposed to
know to try OLSR on this network or not
(04:06:37 PM) _hc: since there are different approaches to sharing metic info
(04:06:53 PM) dcbw: and given that most  networks won't be OLSR, ideally we
don't ask ""enable OLSR?"" for everything you connect to
(04:06:54 PM) _hc: for sure
(04:07:00 PM) dcbw: which is why I was talking about beacon IEs
(04:07:11 PM) dcbw: that would be really, really nice to have :)
(04:07:17 PM) dcbw: since then it would be plug and play really
(04:07:23 PM) _hc: I'm unfamiliar with a beacon IE, how would I implement such
a thing?
(04:07:38 PM) dcbw: are you familiar with  how adhoc wifi works at a lower level?
(04:07:51 PM) dcbw: and BTW, you can't really depend on a specific BSSID
(04:08:01 PM) dcbw: with adhoc you can only depend on the SSID
(04:08:34 PM) dcbw: as drivers/firmware often have ""BSSID coalescing"" schemes
to all arrive at a given BSSID over time
(04:08:35 PM) _hc: we force the BSSID
(04:08:43 PM) dcbw: that doesn't work with all hardware
(04:08:47 PM) _hc: sad but true
(04:08:57 PM) dcbw: and there really isn't a good reason to do it
(04:09:28 PM) _hc: there are good reasons because that algo is fallable
(04:09:44 PM) _hc: well, for an established OLSR mesh, you know the BSSID, its
been there for years, or whatever
(04:09:59 PM) dcbw: oh, so it's a single global BSSID?
16:10
(04:10:07 PM) dcbw: or each mesh has it's own defined BSSID?
(04:10:09 PM) _hc: sometimes the autoselection choses the BSSID of another new
node that is also starting the process of getting on the mesh
(04:10:27 PM) _hc: then they happen mesh together, but ignore the big one that
they really should be talking to
(04:10:41 PM) _hc: each mesh has its own BSSID
(04:11:11 PM) _hc: in bigger meshes, there are parallel meshes for optimization
(04:11:34 PM) _hc: so a private, encrypted backhaul mesh in parallel with a
public, unencrypted one
(04:11:44 PM) _hc: those are separate BSSIDs etc
(04:12:10 PM) _hc: often split by 2.4 and 5.0 GHz, but that's not so relevant here
(04:13:23 PM) dcbw: _hc: so back to adhoc wifi
(04:13:32 PM) dcbw: _hc: with adhoc, stations take turns beaconing
(04:13:50 PM) dcbw: _hc: a beacon is just a packet in the air that advertises
the adhoc (or master-mode) network
(04:14:23 PM) dcbw: _hc: it has a few parts; one standard part whose format
never changes, and then a variable part composed of IEs, which are just TLVs
(Type Length Value)
(04:14:53 PM) _hc: so i know about beaconing in terms of advertising in wifi,
but I've never toyed with that stuff, just read about it, and been aware of it
16:15
(04:15:18 PM) _hc: ok, sounds promising
(04:15:18 PM) dcbw: ideally, OLSR would get a vendor ID assigned and then
could add an IE to the beacon so that anyone doing a scan could instantly know
it's an OLSR-capable network before they even tryto connect
(04:16:04 PM) _hc: getting a vendor ID sounds like a large, institutional process
(04:16:18 PM) dcbw: and there are only 256 of them :(
(04:16:30 PM) dcbw: there is a mechanism for extending though
(04:16:48 PM) _hc: is there a community wifi or hacker mesh vendor ID we can
share? :)
(04:17:01 PM) _hc: that's basically the devs of OLSR
(04:18:33 PM) jreznik_ left the room (quit: Read error: Operation timed out).
(04:19:51 PM) dcbw: _hc: does OLSR have an IEEE OUI?
16:20
(04:21:38 PM) _hc: my guess is no, but let me look
(04:22:16 PM) dcbw: there's a vendor-specific IE, which is defined to be
whatever you want, but you need an IEEE OUI first
(04:22:36 PM) _hc: fyi, I don't think OLSR is incorporated itself, its just
the name of a IETF protocol with one main implementation: olsrd http://olsr.org
(04:22:42 PM) _hc: there are a bunch of orgs involved
(04:22:48 PM) _hc: and some military contractors
(04:23:31 PM) dcbw: might make sense to get one so this specific issue can be
made smoother for users, otherwise this sort of thing never gets better...
(04:23:52 PM) dcbw: at least on Linux it seems fairly easy to send the beacon
template that could include the OLSR IE
(04:24:05 PM) dcbw: in any case, that's the future (ideally)
(04:24:31 PM) dcbw: then everything can be automatic
16:25
(04:25:00 PM) dcbw: for OLPC we just used link-local iPv4 addresses
(04:25:38 PM) dcbw: of which there are 64k
(04:26:33 PM) _hc: does the OLPC mesh route to the internet too?
(04:27:06 PM) dcbw: yes, through mesh portals
(04:27:35 PM) dcbw: but the point of all that is, non-802.11s OLPC meshing has
a known SSID so when connecting we know exactly what to do
(04:27:42 PM) _hc: so its a minor abuse of the link-local addresses to connect
them to the internet, no?
(04:27:44 PM) dcbw: which isn't the case for OLSR
(04:27:58 PM) dcbw: _hc: at least when I was working on that stuff, the portal
NAT-ed everyone to the internet
(04:28:40 PM) dcbw: so for OLSR, the core problem is that you don't know it's
OLSR until after you've connected, which isn't a great user experience because
you need to know it's OLSR so you don't try DHCP or something by default
(04:29:12 PM) _hc: right
(04:29:29 PM) dcbw: at the moment it's looking more like this is more a L3+
issue than anything wifi related
(04:29:38 PM) _hc: then either olsrd will already be running, or nm needs to
trigger it to start
16:30
(04:30:01 PM) _hc: if olsrd is running, it'll see the change in the net if,
and respond by broadcasting to find other nodes
(04:30:25 PM) dcbw: can also be  done through dispatcher scripts, assuming
olsrd has some sane control interface
(04:30:39 PM) dcbw: and doesn't need to be restarted on every network change
(04:30:43 PM) _hc: I can write a sane control interface :)
(04:30:47 PM) _hc: it probably doesn't exist
(04:31:09 PM) dcbw: there are 3 core problems I see here:
(04:31:28 PM) dcbw: 1) how we're supposed to know that the network is running
OLSR so we can do (2) and (3)
(04:31:50 PM) dcbw: 2) after associating, we need a specific IP configuration
method when using OLSR
(04:31:57 PM) dcbw: 3) something needs to kick olsrd
(04:32:10 PM) dcbw: if (1) gets solved, then (2) and (3) are easy
(04:32:32 PM) dcbw: but (1) has to get solved in a way that doesn't
necessarily require more checkboxes every time you connect to an adhoc network
(04:32:57 PM) dcbw: and ideally also doesn't require editing a config file
somewhere, since that's pretty much the opposite of easy to use
(04:32:58 PM) jheretic [~jheretic at 64.124.162.98] entered the room.
(04:33:18 PM) dcbw: which is why the beacon IE is a nice solution
(04:33:45 PM) _hc: dcbw: so what about this approach: we make it easy to have
pre-configured meshes, then if the BSSID and channel match, it'll do its OLSR
thing
(04:33:50 PM) _hc: so its a manual approach to #1
(04:34:01 PM) _hc: but once in place will provide full auto-detect
(04:34:50 PM) _hc: it would also hopefully mean that once people figure out
how to do good full auto detect of OLSR meshes, the nm code wouldn't have to
change much
(04:34:55 PM) _hc: since 2 and 3 would be the same
16:35
(04:35:18 PM) dcbw: if you're going the preconfigured route, then this gets
easier since you can just tell NM that it's OLSR instead of doing BSSID and
channel matching
(04:35:32 PM) dcbw: as in olsr=true or whatever for the network config
(04:35:58 PM) dcbw: _hc: then it's pretty easy
(04:36:12 PM) dcbw: _hc: NM has a 'dispatcher' functionality that calls
scripts in /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d
(04:36:21 PM) dcbw: and it passes a lot of information in the environment
(04:36:30 PM) _hc: I mean that a user could download  a package of OLSR
configs that plug into NM
(04:36:32 PM) dcbw: which could potentially include OLSR=true or whatever
(04:36:51 PM) dcbw: hmm, potentially
(04:36:52 PM) _hc: then when NM sees an adhoc net that matches the profile,
it'll automatically set it up as an OLSR mesh
(04:38:10 PM) dcbw: is the IP addressing scheme well-defined?
(04:38:14 PM) dcbw: or is it site-specific
(04:38:29 PM) _hc: can this dispatcher mode pre-screen things? like I click on
""commotionwireless.net"" in the Wireless Networking list, then some code
somewhere check it, and says ""this is OLSR, config it as such"", then it skips
the normal wiif config?
(04:38:41 PM) _hc: its mesh-specific, that would be part of the profile
(04:38:42 PM) dcbw: not at this time, no
(04:39:08 PM) dcbw: so what all is part of the profile?
(04:39:29 PM) _hc: SSID, BSSID, channel, ip-scheme, olsrd.config
16:40
(04:40:05 PM) dcbw: and what are the IP schemes?
(04:40:31 PM) dcbw: (as in, what specifically is the addressing randomization
algorithm, and what ranges of IP does ""ip-scheme"" allow?)
(04:41:53 PM) _hc: since the meshes are all run by various groups, they range
from static IPs to random within a range, a range with last bytes of MAC,
ahcpd, etc
(04:43:35 PM) _hc: it seems to me that NM only needs to know about BSSID and
channel, then the olsr logic would handle the rest
(04:44:03 PM) _hc: I mean in terms of marking an ahdoc  as an OLSR mesh
(04:44:38 PM) dcbw: well, NM handles the IP configuration on the interface too
(04:44:45 PM) dcbw: and stuff like DNS
(04:44:55 PM) dcbw: so NM would be doing the actual IP configuration, more orless
16:45
(04:45:09 PM) _hc: ok
(04:45:14 PM) _hc: makes sense
(04:45:25 PM) dcbw: btw where does the station get DNS servers from?
(04:45:39 PM) _hc: that's also part of the mesh config
(04:45:58 PM) dcbw: so they're static?
(04:45:59 PM) _hc: some are static, some use advertisments on the mesh
(04:46:03 PM) dcbw: ah
(04:47:06 PM) _hc: would it be possible to make dhclient kind of scripts that
NM delegates to?
(04:47:41 PM) dcbw: not in the way you're thinking, but having more hooks into
the mechanisms is an enhancement goal
(04:48:22 PM) _hc: so with NM, is dhclient the only mechanism for using some
external thing to config IP and DNS?
(04:48:51 PM) dcbw: _hc: or avahi-autoip, or IPv6 router advertisements, or
static configuration
(04:48:57 PM) dcbw: _hc: or PPP
(04:49:00 PM) dcbw: _hc: or VPNs
(04:49:39 PM) _hc: so it seems that OLSR meshes with specific needs could make
a kind of avahi-autoip as part of the config
16:50
(04:50:06 PM) dcbw: yeah, that would be the idea, though we'd want to do this
more formally in NM
(04:50:18 PM) dcbw: well, with a more formal modular structure
(04:50:57 PM) dcbw: quite a few things want something like this
(04:50:59 PM) _hc: is there way in NM to have it ask something external for
the IP/DNS info, then it handle the actual setting of the interface, etc?
(04:51:03 PM) _hc: is that waht you mean?
(04:51:23 PM) _hc: that would be very nice for the OLSR mesh stuff, then the
IP config could be represented in a little script
(04:51:33 PM) _hc: that generates the numbers
(04:51:34 PM) dcbw: _hc: that's exactly how dhcp, autoip, ipv6, ppp, and vpn
already work, just that they're more or less hardcoded into NM
(04:51:43 PM) _hc: ah, I see
(04:51:49 PM) dcbw: _hc: you'd want more than a ""little script""
(04:52:06 PM) dcbw: since that ""plugin"" if you will would also be responsible
for getting DNS, possibly from advertisements
(04:52:16 PM) dcbw: and thus would need to listen for them
(04:53:16 PM) _hc: so any suggestions on where I should start on this?  do you
think it'll only be possible with modifications on NM itself, or would any
kind of ""plugin"" be an option?
(04:53:33 PM) _hc: I looked at the VPN Plugins, they seem to tied to the idea
of a VPN
(04:54:02 PM) _hc: but if the VPN plugins can handle the BSSID/channel stuff,
it might be one way to get started
(04:54:22 PM) dcbw: _hc: vpns have to layer on top of existing hardware
connections so they wouldn't really be suitable
(04:54:29 PM) dcbw: _hc: we'd want the best way of fixing it :)  which would
mean plugins, really
(04:54:38 PM) dcbw: which needs some architecting thought
16:55
(04:55:01 PM) dcbw: since you'd want the ability for plugins at different
levels of the process, and the ability to pass information back and forth
(04:55:09 PM) jheretic left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 244 seconds).
(04:56:09 PM) _hc: I've been employed to work on this stuff, so I'm happy to
dig in wherever you think is helpful
(04:56:19 PM) dcbw: _hc: and that would be excellent
(04:56:34 PM) _hc: in case you are interested, I'm working as part of this;
https://commotionwireless.net/
(04:56:55 PM) dcbw: cool
(04:57:03 PM) _hc: the only rub is that my wife is due anyday so I'm going to
disappear for 6ish weeks once the baby comes :-D
(04:57:10 PM) dcbw: heh :)
(04:57:17 PM) dcbw: congratulations
(04:57:18 PM) _hc: perfect time to start a new project ;)
(04:57:19 PM) _hc: thanks
(04:57:31 PM) dcbw: any day you'll be starting a new project :)
(04:57:41 PM) dcbw: one that will last a looooooong time
(04:57:48 PM) _hc: hehe, I have one already, so its just adding to the
maelstrom :)
(04:58:28 PM) _hc: by the way, some of the pauses in this convo were from my
15 month old son insisting on turning my monitor on and off
(04:58:48 PM) _hc: he's little so he can sneak up
(04:58:52 PM) dcbw: _hc: so lets stop thinking about OLSR specifically and
starting thinking more generally about how to make it work the best way that
OLSR can also integrate with
(04:59:11 PM) _hc: ok, sounds good
17:00
(05:00:23 PM) dcbw: _hc: first is to define that generic plugin interface
including how plugins register themselves for certain hooks, how plugins can
attach information to the interface activation process (ie, connecting) and at
what points they get asked to do things
(05:01:27 PM) dcbw: it might be as simple as passing the NMConnection to each
plugin at each step and asking if the plugin wants to do something
(05:01:36 PM) dcbw: which is basically how it works internally
(05:01:45 PM) dcbw: internally there are 5 steps
(05:01:57 PM) _hc: ok, fyi, I'm a long time NM user, and have done a little NM
scripting with dbus, but the dev is new to me.  but I've been doing C for 10+
years, and was a network manager before that, so I'm not starting from nothing ;)
(05:02:16 PM) dcbw: good to hear :)
(05:03:04 PM) _hc: I'll see if I can check out the code in parallel
(05:03:05 PM) dcbw: each step can return SUCCESS (everything already done,
like static IP where we just set the IP address and return), POSTPONE (ie dhcp
where we need to start dhcp and then wait for the answer to come back maybe 30
seconds later) and FAILURE (something went wrong, fail the interface)
(05:03:32 PM) dcbw: we also have some things that are really global plugins,
like for DNS handling
(05:03:37 PM) _hc: what if the plugin doesn't want to do anything?
(05:04:10 PM) _hc: like for the OLSR plugin: ""is this adhoc? no, then
nevermind...""
(05:04:23 PM) dcbw: _hc: that's just the general way things work right now;
we'd want a more formalized mechanism for the plugin interface itself
(05:04:30 PM) dcbw: but it's a fairly good mapping so far
17:05
(05:05:06 PM) dcbw: eventually we'd turn some of the internal stuff into
plugins as well
(05:05:39 PM) dcbw: like the avahi-autoipd IPv4 stuff is a great candidate
(05:05:53 PM) _hc: ok, so this is something already in the works?
(05:06:01 PM) dcbw: no, just been thinking about this for a while
(05:06:15 PM) dcbw: and how to best make it happen
(05:06:26 PM) dcbw: with minimal disruption

855,Commotion-dev, NetworKManager: the good news and the bad news,"Thu, 25 Oct 2012 09:33:32 +1030",+1030,Jeremy Lakeman,"A pre-association test would be great. A beacon IE message sounds
interesting. Wifi-Direct service discovery might also be useful, but I
don't know if it's possible while still connected to an adhoc network.

Assuming we can't get that to work, or to support current devices that
have no hope of that working, what about the following;

associate with adhoc network
try dhcp / adhcp
fall back to link local IPv4 (+IPv6?)
send probe broadcast UDP packet to well known port (repeat a few times)

any mesh routing daemons respond with a packet in a well defined format like;

header
- format version
- protocol type (olsr, batman, experiment#3, serval, ...)
- message to display to user if protocol unknown (eg ""See olsr.net for
more info"")

generic IP config
- IP / netmask
- DNS
- etc

optional protocol specific config
...

Once the network is up, you keep the link local IP address so you can
respond to similar requests.

That's correct, but its also much more widespread than just GNOME and
Debian/Ubuntu.  I think basically every distro installs it by default, and it
also is fully supported in KDE as well as other environments.  Basically, if
you are doing user networking with GNU/Linux these days, its running
NetworkManager or you're an ueber-geek ;)

Sounds like we either need a wifi vendor ID or an IEEE OUI to do that.
Getting a wifi vendor ID sounds basically impossible, but perhaps not an IEEE
OUI.  Isn't there someone at Battlemesh who had one for this stuff?

We discussed that in the conversation below.  Upon thinking about it more, I
think it is not workable since that means NetworkManager would have to attach
to every adhoc network it sees in order to provide a scan of which networks
are OLSR-capable.  That could easily make the scanning very slow and error
prone since you'd have to wait for a lot of timeouts before you could do
anything else with the network interface.

862,Commotion-dev, Commotion's Community Governance Guidelines,"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 15:39:33 -0500",-0500,Seamus Tuohy,"Hello All,

We have been working on the following draft of Commotion's Community
Governance Guidelines. The first is a proposal for the overarching
Commotion project guidelines. The second is a proposed individual
project guideline for code submission and review. Now that we have a
rough sketch of what we think we should include we would like to see
what the active community wants added, removed, reworded, etc.



Commotion Community Governance Guidelines

  * The Commotion project is an open source, free software toolkit. The
    community welcomes all contributions and conversations that help the
    project grow and improve in accordance with its mission.
  * Commotion?s Mission and Goals are guided by the active developers
    and community stakeholders who contribute to the project community.
    Active developers of Commotion projects will guide the development
    of their individual project.
  * The Commotion project team encourages communities to customize the
    software to better meet local needs. We request that all
    customizations be contributed or communicated back to the Commotion
    community so that improvements can be reused without undue
    duplication of effort.
  * Work on Commotion should do no harm to existing projects. Projects
    that implement new code that breaks the existing functionality of
    other Commotion projects should work with the community of the
    existing project in order to provide support for the existing
    functions.

  * New members may contribute to existing Commotion projects by
    collaborating with active developers. Each Commotion subproject will
    maintain an active version-controlled code repository. Guidelines
    for contribution will be managed by each project?s active
    developers, and will be posted on each project?s development page.


Commotion Project Governance Guidelines

To contribute to the (___________) project?s code repository you must
post contributions to the development list for review. When the
community has reviewed them you will be asked to submit a request to
submit code so that the community can add your code to the project. At
the point when repository administrators believe that you have a strong
grasp of your contributed code?s effect on the rest of the code base,
and that your intentions are to further the goals of the project with
all of your contributions, you may be granted access to submit code
directly to the code base without review. Malicious or damaging code
that is submitted will cause those privileges to be revoked immediately.



Thanks,
Seamus 2e

have a clear understanding of the project. If they are included here, it 
could become easy to evaluate proposals and decisions using the Mission

Sorry for the long delay...I got busy with some other tasks and this 
dropped off my radar.  We were able to test the new builds today, and 
they seem to work fine, no problems.  We were able to mesh just fine 
with our existing Commotion mesh network, though we weren't able to 
test multi-hop since we would have to spread out pretty far in order to 
get out of single-hop range of each other.

That's something we haven't changed from the default install. This
setup still uses the same database for local number registrations via
the web UI or SMS message.

We've mainly been assuming that the BTS boxes don't trust each other
and might be administered independently.
Though if a number of boxes did trust each other, they could use our
rhizome file transport to share SIM card details and last known
location, even if the network is not always available.
The basic pieces we've built could probably be adapted into this kind
of deployment with some scripting and changes to the dialplan.

With no single point of failure, one BTS box could still allow local
phone calls and any two boxes could form a working network.
Though we still have a lot of work to do, improving codec support and
our routing protocol. With servald handling the network routing and
packet delivery, the network layer has the potential to carry more
simultaneous calls over a wifi network.
We'll need to do a lot more testing to see how well that claim pans
out in practice.

> Does Serval DNA works well with thousands of users?

Good question, no idea. There will probably be scalability issues
we'll need to deal with so we don't flood a large network just trying
to resolve phone numbers. Probably some kind of election process to
pick a small number of network nodes to collect and search the entire
phone directory.

> Does Serval support SMS messages?

We have a text messaging solution for android, where we can assume
that one identity is only reachable via one instance of the software.
We'd need to build something a bit different to deliver messages to
users roaming between BTS boxes. We haven't tackled that yet, but we
might get around to it eventually.

Either way, the rhizome bundle is likely to be addressed to a public

haven't really dealt with how the user will choose a recipient for

We need a better way to indicate which instances of servald have a

generalise our phone directory lookup to allow for other types of
service discovery.

There could be several reasons for that. Ones which come to my mind:

 1. Phone thinks that it's already registered and just does not
communicate with the BTS at all. Then there is not reason for the BTS
to contact with the Subscriber Registry. This may happen if you power
on a BTS soon enough after you powered it off - for a phone it looks
like BTS signal was lost and then re-appear, e.g. like you went to a
tunnel and came back. To force a phone to register after a BTS restart
is to change BTS's LAC. In that case a phone thinks it moved to
another Location Area and will send a Location Update Request (LUR).

 2. ""SIP.Proxy.Registration"" configuration parameter is not configured
properly in the OpenBTS installation.

Thus I recommend you to:
 * Double-check SIP.Proxy.Registration configuration parameter.
 * Run Wireshark and check for SIP traffic.
 * Run `tail -f <OpenBTS_logs>` and check whether there is any traffic
between the phone and the BTS when you expect it.

Asterisk doesn't write to Subscriber Registry db. It's sipauthserve
and OpenBTS who write to it. IIRC, OpenBTS only writes non-essential
things like IMEI and RRLP coordinates to it, while sipauthserve writes
the actual phone location (aka IP:port) to it. This have to be checked
vs the code to be sure.

What issue do you have with this?

Different chipsets has different GSM stacks and thus their behavior is
different. Also there are chipsets with buggy GSM stacks (esp. Chinese
ones), which doesn't make life easier. To add some salt, OpenBTS
implementation of GSM is not complete - GSM uses state machines, while
OpenBTS assumes it's a linear sequence of messages. And we already
know some places where this breaks execution and OpenBTS just hangs a
call instead of processing it. I'd love to fix this, but it requires
quite some time and effort.

You can set a log file either with an environment variable
SERVALD_LOG_FILE, or by setting a log.file configuration value.

The vomp channel driver should log something to the asterisk log while
asterisk is starting. Asterisk should also log something if it failed
to load the module.
Is the module file readable by the user running asterisk?

Once the channel driver has started, servald should also log that it
has a connected client.

Not quite. If you set the phone number of the servald instance on the
bts box to the echo number in asterisk, then this is the extension
that the vomp channel driver will connect you to when dialling the
public key of the bts box.
eg;
servald keyring list
servald set did [sid] [did] [name]

But you'll need to work out why the channel driver isn't registering
first. Hopefully that's the only remaining piece of the puzzle that
isn't working.

On our box I replaced the asterisk installation with a newly built one.

Yes, we're aware that multiple identities have not been tested. I'm
fairly certain that the routing engine doesn't really deal with them
properly.

Just spent a minute looking around for a dhcp lease count collectd 
plugin, but didn't find one. Iptables is one way of doing it, or 
another option is to write a shell script collectd plugin using 
https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Exec that runs ""cat 
/var/dhcpd.leases | wc -l""

iptables will give a more accurate picture of instantaneous # of users, 
i think.

Make sure you loaded the rrdtool plugin. It can't collect data if it

The updates exist in a branch of fork-shell called io. To test
fork-shell with the Android app, do the following:

1. From your MeshTether source code root directory,
cd external/fork-shell
2. git pull
3. git checkout io
4. cd -
5. make -C external/ (or the make command you use to build MeshTether

Any other locations where folks have both deployed Commotion nodes, and are
active readers of this listserv?

I do not have Commotion nodes deployed consistently in St. Louis (yet), due
to lack of spare hardware available, but I could start pestering some of my
compadres about volunteering for guinea pig duty in exchange for the
awesome wifi.

Finally, and in follow-up to this issue filed about wifi spottiness ...
https://code.commotionwireless.net/issues/342#change-1015
... where to start on a good template for users to follow in reporting bugs?

I can report from years of experience in WasabiNet-land that the lack of
such a template will yield you lots of reports along the lines of ""the wifi
is broken,"" with no other details.  It shouldn't be unreasonable to expect
users willing to file issue reports to also offer with some specific
information.  Indeed, that is the norm on the Lanchdpad queues for Ubuntu,
etc.

The bug reporting form presently available is here:
https://commotionwireless.net/report

What additional data points should we ask for?  For instance ...

- Type of user's device (laptop, tablet, smartphone)
- User's OS and version
- Additional info about user's wifi adapter/driver, if available (e.g.
carl9170, madwifi)
- Type of Commotion node, i.e. UBNT access point, Android device
- Version of Commotion (PR2, PR3, DR1)
- Additional notes about quality of wifi signal, e.g. user had weak signal
to Commotion node, Commotion node itself had weak signal back to gateway
node.

Finally, would it be good to provide a conspicuous link on the bug
reporting form to wiki page(s) explaining how to check for other wifi
devices on a particular 802.11 channel?  That wiki page could provide some
high-level instructions, broken down by popular OS's and devices, about how
to scan the area for free wifi channels.

Besides adding more detail about mission and goals, I think this would be
good publish on the wiki sooner than later, to help Commotion better
identify itself (both to 'insiders' and 'outsiders') as a project based on

Presumably, these guidelines would also help establish the process one goes

891,Commotion-dev," Whether to use encrypted meshing,","Thu, 6 Dec 2012 16:47:10 -0600",-0600,Ben West,"Hi All,

Apologies for the serial emails.

I've been successfully deploying WPA2-encrypted adhoc meshes using OpenWRT
v12.09 beta (aka Attitude Adjustment) here in St. Louis, so I'm starting
this discussion thread now to anticipate Commotion itself presumably moving
the OpenWRT v12.09 stable, when available.  Likewise for when or if Android
adhoc support (and all the Bug 82 drama) achieves enough resolution to also
support encrypted meshing.

This thread doesn't need to have any bearing on the current n2n tunneling
application in Commotion, which can effectively operate as an independent
layer of encryption (albeit with bandwidth constrained by the node's CPU).

First off, here are the assumptions I'm making w/r/t to security, both for
maintenance of such security and to help manage expectations:

   - WPA2 encryption, while certainly better than no encryption, can still
   be broken readily w/o the users of the network knowing about it.
   Realistically, WPA2 encryption can deter casual snooping or routing
   interference, but it should not be considered robust.
   - The decision to use WPA2 encrypted meshing should likewise include the
   decision to use a PSK key of maximum possible entropy (e.g. 63 random
   chars), and a mutual policy to change the key periodically on all nodes.
   - Any wireless transmission of sensitive info to or from a remote node,
   whether or not the mesh uses WPA2 encryption, should itself be thru an
   SSH/SSL/VPN tunnel.  By 'sensitive' I understand firmware images, config
   data including PSK or OLSR keys, passwords, users' MAC addresses, etc.

Next, here are potential questions a Commotion user should answer for
him/herself before encrypting the mesh.  These could help the mesh users
better understand what security the encryption does and doesn't provide.

   - Do you want strangers whom you or other mesh custodians have never met
   to have the ability to configure their nodes and join your mesh on their
   own?  If so, you probably don't need encryption, at least not on the mesh
   where you would like strangers to join.
   - Alternately, would you like such strangers to contact you (or other
   mesh custodians) *in person*, to arrange proper configuration of their
   node?  If not, then this mesh wouldn't benefit from encryption.
   - Furthermore, do you mind recently acquainted strangers, upon having
   their nodes configured to join your encrypted mesh, thereafter gaining the
   ability to observe all (non-tunneled) traffic on the mesh?  If you do mind,
   then this mesh probably doesn't need encryption.

Finally, what are your thoughts for mechanisms for adding new nodes to an
encrypted mesh?  At least, so that the mesh's encryption retains some
degree of usefulness.

   - *Quantum entanglement* metaphor.  Similar to how quantum particles
   become entangled only when in the immediate vicinity of each other, new
   nodes (and their owners) must be brought physically to an existing node and
   its owner.  The new node is configured with the mesh WPA key in person
   only, and thereafter taken to its desired location.
   - *Airmail pickup* metaphor, as illustrated in this
photo<http://npm.si.edu/exhibits/2c2b4_2_stinson.html>.
   A new node is flashed with default settings and installed at a location
   w/in useful wireless range of a encrypted mesh, and the MAC of that node's
   radio is emailed to the mesh custodians, who add it to an internal
   whitelist on their end.  Thereafter, the nodes in the encrypted mesh all
   periodically (e.g. once per day, at off-hours) disable their APs and switch
   their mesh interface to the default channel, w/o encryption, and scan for
   the MAC of the new node.  Upon completing the scan, the nodes switch back
   to encrypted operation.  If an already-configured node finds it is range of
   the new node, it transmits (via SSH/SSL/VPN tunnel) relevant config data
   and the WPA key to new node, who then reboots to join the encrypted mesh.

That's the $64k question.

In order to place any trust in the encryption layer you must also
trust every single person or device that knows the keys to join the
mesh. Wifi encryption may be providing a false sense of security.

We have been thinking about some of these problems with the Serval
Project for a while as well.
While we have not come up with a complete solution, we realised early
on that having an unforgeable network identity would be a very useful
thing for any sensible solution in this space.  This is why we use
public keys as the network identifier on the Serval Overlay Mesh
(which is what VoMP sits on).

This means you can at least work out, in a completely distributed
system, whether you are talking to the node that you think you are.
>From there you can start building up the necessary features to obtain
Byzantine Robustness.

On that note, Radia Perlman
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radia_Perlman), who wrote the paper
about achieving Routing with Byzantine Robustness
(http://labs.oracle.com/techrep/2005/smli_tr-2005-146.pdf), is one of
the keynotes at Linux Conf Australia this coming January.  A bunch of
us from Serval intend to be there, and might pick her brains on this.

More generally her paper about Routing with Byzantine Robustness is
well worth us all reading (or re-reading) as we look for solutions in
this space.

900,Commotion-dev, Experiences with AR7xxx based USB wifi adapter?,"Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:36:39 -0600",-0600,Ben West,"Hi All,

Part of the envisioned testing procedure Commotion involves simulating
multiple nodes (OpenWRT or otherwise) bound together via a virtual mesh
under one VirtualBox host.  Although the mac80211_hwsim library does show
some promise for simulating wireless networks, that library as-is does not
support a single (virtual) radio broadcasting both the adhoc mesh and the
APs.  I instead had been instantiated multiple virtual radios for each
(B)SSID and bridging that radio with a virtual wired interface.

This works, but the Commotion auto-configuration tool doesn't support it,
requiring manual configuration of the nodes, which ultimately reduces the
usefulness of the test procedure.

Other the other hand, VirtualBox is claimed to support connecting USB
peripherals directly to VMs, which opens up the possibility of connecting
USB wifi adapters, i.e. physical radios, to virtual nodes.  I.e. multiple
USB wifi adapters hanging off extension cables plugged into a hub, with
each radio turned down to minimum tx power.

Does anyone on the list happen to have good experience with a particular
brand/model inexpensive USB wifi stick based on Atheros AR72xx?  I happen
to have a single such stick sitting around, brand SMC, but I thus far found
the carl9170 driver that Ubuntu selects for that device kinda crappy.

I can't help much with the definition of test cases wrt mesh and radio,
but I might be able to help writing voice test cases. Do you have a format
in mind for these? (And eventually, where would they live?)

I believe Seamus recently built a VirtualBox image of Commotion-OpenWRT,
so he might be able to shed some light on how he managed the network
interfaces.

As for a solid USB wifi adapter, I am a big fan of the Alfa AWUS036NEH,
as it supports ad-hoc out-of-the-box on recent linux kernels, and can do
master mode with hostapd just fine. However, I have not been able to use
it to create more than one virtual interface in different wifi modes on
a single Alfa card...so no dual ad-hoc/AP interfaces with one radio.

I've also briefly tried out the TP-Link TL-WN821N, before I melted it
using a cheap USB hub. It has an Atheros chipset that also uses the
carl9170 driver, so probably isn't useful to you if you've had bad
experiences with that driver. As far as I know there is no USB wifi card
based on Atheros AR72xx. linuxwireless.org is my go-to place for
cross-referencing devices to chipsets:

908,Commotion-dev, Experiences with AR7xxx based USB wifi adapter?,"Wed, 12 Dec 2012 13:50:40 -0600",-0600,Ben West,"Hi All,

To follow up, I've made good progress actually getting a USB wifi stick to
work with a VirtualBox guest.  Whether this works or not appears to be
dependent on both your OS and the brand/model of USB wifi adapter.

Thus far, I've verified this works.  Or at least that the guest VM
correctly identifies the USB wifi and loads a driver for it:

VBox host: Ubuntu v11.10 on 32bit x86
VBox version v4.2.4 r81684 (downloaded from virtualbox.org)
VBox extension pack v4.2.4 r81684
Cisco/Linksys WUSB54GC v3 (aka Ralink rt2870)
... with VBox guest Ubuntu v12.10
... with VBox guest Windows XP
*... with VBox guest Commotion OpenWRT* (using rt2800usb kernel model)

On the other hand, my SMCWUSB-N2 (Atheros AR9170 chip) USB adapter does not
work with the VirtualBox USB gateway, regardless of guest OS, which appears
to be specific to this adapter.

Beside Dan's suggestion of AWUS036NEH and TP-Link TL-WN821N, this URL seems
to suggest the TP-Link USB sticks (which are Atheros based) do work for
guests under VirtualBox.  So I'm a gonna get me a couple.
http://top-hat-sec.com/forum/index.php?topic=960.0

Finally, the meshconfig tool doesn't support USB wifu adapters,
unsurprisingly, but I am assuming that modifying it to support such would
be less effort-intensive that modifying mac80211_hwsim.

This should hopefully streamline Commotion testing dramatically, since it
would permit a VM node to mesh directly with physical nodes.

 1. Do a fresh install of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on a laptop (32-bit for
    better hardware compatibility).
 2. Enable main/restricted/universe/multiverse repositories
 3. apt-get update/dist-upgrade and then install dependencies: autoconf

    libsqlite3-dev erlang libreadline6-dev libboost-all-dev subversion
    git libxml2-dev
 4. Download source code into home directory:
     1. svn checkout http://svn.asterisk.org/svn/asterisk/branches/1.8
        asterisk-1.8
     2. svn co http://wush.net/svn/range/software/public openbts (or
        whatever version you like)
     3. git clone git://github.com/servalproject/serval-dna.git
     4. git clone git://github.com/servalproject/app_servaldna.git
     5. wget http://www.olsr.org/releases/0.6/olsrd-0.6.4.tar.bz2
 5. build and install OLSRd (including nameservice, jsoninfo, txtinfo
    plugins in lib/ directory); configure /etc/olsrd.conf as needed (I
    used Commotion-specific settings)
 6. build and install asterisk
 7. build serval-dna
 8. build and configure app_servaldna (following steps here:
    https://github.com/servalproject/serval-dna/blob/master/doc/OpenBts-setup.md)
 9. add the following to /etc/asterisk/extensions.conf:

        [phones]
        include => openbts

10. build, install, and configure OpenBTS
11. create /etc/rc.local script to start and configure everything on
    boot
    (https://code.commotionwireless.net/projects/commotion-openbts/repository/revisions/liveboot/entry/liveboot/rc.local)
12. rm ~/.bash_history and any other unnecessary customizations ;)
13. install remastersys and create a backup (do not use the ""distro"" option)
14. create bootable USB with the resulting .iso
15. profit

That's the process I used. Let me know if there are any other details
that would be helpful!

W.r.t. authsae mentioned by Daniel, I do find this patch for adding an
authsae daemon to OpenWRT, although I believe this patch is targeted for
802.11s.
http://patchwork.openwrt.org/patch/1350/

Likewise this ticket in the OpenWRT queue:
https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/12078

Further investigation into authsae options for 802.11n adhoc leads to this
issue filed by Will Hawkins on a very familiar looking website:
https://code.commotionwireless.net/issues/305

""Submitted some patches upstream to cozybit authsae project. Next up,
attempting to upstream patches to the kernel.""

Will, do you happen to links to the patch submissions you made for kernel

mention of authsae in recent OpenWRT-devel chatter.)

Funny how the mind works. The type of test cases I had in mind were kind
of perpendicular to those you listed:
- initiate call, caller hang-up
- initiate call, called hang-up
- initiate call, caller put on hold, caller hang up
etc.

We obviously need to document both directions.

Might anyone have a Ubiquitui Nanostation M2 which they could flash with
current generation Commotion, boot up, and then extract the tarball gz of
the configuration generated by meshconfig?  (You can do this from the luci
web UI via System -> Backup, I believe.)  I am needing an example of the
network/wireless/firewall setup which meshconfig generates on a device with
two LAN ports, like the NSM2.

Also, if you would prefer, it's fine to scrub the tarball of any private
info you would prefer not to share, e.g. password shadow file, wifi MAC
address.  I do nevertheless promise not to a deploy a 500meter wide yagi
antenna from here in Missouri to snoop on your wifi. ;)

920,Commotion-dev, Unifying Serval and Commotion Mesh,"Mon, 17 Dec 2012 12:37:38 +1030",+1030,Paul Gardner-Stephen,"Hi All,

>From a Serval Project perspective, we see much value in converging on
a single ""standard"" SSID (and ideally BSSID) for WiFi mesh networks
for Serval and Commotion.  The logical choice is almost certainly to
use whatever values that Commotion uses.

In fact, what we would like to see in time is that Commotion and
Serval's Android ad-hoc WiFi mesh management software converge into a
single thing, and possible a single APK that contains all Commotion
and Serval functions, or possibly it will be two separate APKs --
there are arguments for and against.

But back to the present...

The BSSID/ad-hoc bug issues on Android phones remains a source of
intense pain (which is part of why we are working on a ""mesh helper""
device that would basically be a cross between an OpenWRT router and
mobile phone, that would basically be pocket-sized battery-powered
WiFi adhoc+AP plus long-range UHF radio).

So I am not sure that a final solution is possible now, but we are
thinking about our default SSID for the Serval Mesh 0.90 release we
are hoping to have out by Christmas, and we hope to continue the
conversation about converging this all as much as possible.

Our feeling in the lab here is that until we have interoperation
sorted out, that we will probably default to a serval-specific SSID,
probably mesh.servalproject.org, so that it will point people to a
(yet to be populated) web page where they can learn more.  But for
0.91 and later, we hope to make moves towards convergence.  Perhaps
having a short list of configured network names and patterns is the
next step, but this is all really thinking out loud for now.

This is something that we've been thinking about recently here at OTI as
well. I think it makes a lot of sense to standardize around SSIDs and
BSSIDs. Additionally, I'm working on rewriting the way that the OpenWRT
firmware handles connecting to the mesh as a standalone C daemon and
library, something that I hope may eventually serve as a cross-platform
way to manage configuration profiles and wireless connection issues in a
generalized fashion.

In the short term, I've been thinking too about how to make sure that
the Commotion Android application and Serval can work together
effectively on the same device. Would it make sense for Serval to make
use of Meshtether to establish the wifi network if it's available, and
for Meshtether to connect to the Serval application's instance of
servald for encryption, if available?

Some variation on that makes a lot of sense.  Probably we should look
at what we have in Meshtether and Serval Mesh, and cherry pick the
best from each, so that we can support the most handsets, and then
fold it into one single app that does mesh on Android, and nothing
else.  We can then make use of that (and even bundle it inside) the
Commotion and Serval Mesh APKs.

We are already exposing some APIs on Android for using servald, and we
have wanted for a while to think about the right way to expand that
out, and allow servald to offer secure mesh communications for any app
on the phone (possibly with a SuperUser.apk style prompting the first
(or each) time an app wants to use the mesh).

Both of these would be great for us to find resources to work on and
really facilitate the kind of improved simplicity, interoperability
and de-duplication of effort and interfaces that I think will pay
dividends.

One of the things that might affect how we do that, is that with
support from NLnet Foundation we have begun prototyping non-WiFi mesh
options, e.g., UHF ISM band packet radio, that will be supported by
the Serval Mesh on a ""Mesh Helper"" device in future.

It would make sense to tie that closely with servald, since servald
will need to use these packet radio interfaces which will not be
exposed as an operating system network interface (we don't want ARP
and chatty 3G/4G designed applications cluttering the limited
bandwidth we can obtain).

Yet, it would make sense for all the mesh interfaces to be handled by
the one application, and to offer a unified interface to that, which
suggests it should be in whatever combined application we create for
handling mesh communications.

Perhaps what all this means is that the combined mesh application
should actually be where servald runs.  Then it is just the
user-facing services that end up in a separate app.

Of course, the mesh control and servald are the largest parts of the
Serval Mesh app right now, and so then it starts feeling like all the
Serval Mesh apk functionality should be in there, in which case
convergence would be logical by cherry picking from Meshtether into
the Serval Mesh apk, and changing the Serval Mesh wifi settings to
follow the Commotion scheme. Else the Serval Mesh user services
(telephony, rhizome etc) are accessed from a separate app, but that
feels like artificial separation, and doesn't any significant
advantages, at least as I think about it at 04.15h.

I am not totally settled on all this yet, and this is largely thinking
out loud, but it seems like there is a good potential solution space
that it makes sense to explore further.

We have been looking at this sort of thing with Serval, too.
I think having a URL is a great way to use SSIDs as free advertising,
and to help people learn about what is being offered.  I think it also
encourages people to connect, although I think we might want to think
about doing some sort of study to find out what makes people think an

The Dragino M12, if that is what you have, is an Atheros AR2317 based
device, which should load the 'atheros' target firmware images for
Commotion.
http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/dragino/ms12

I have compiled Commotion-OpenWRT fine for atheros target, and I've checked
in the .config file(s) I used to the repo here:
https://code.commotionwireless.net/projects/commotion-openwrt/repository/show?rev=ath5kMinimal

I also have pre-compiled atheros images & config you could try here:
http://info.gowasabi.net/commotion-openwrt/openwrt/atheros.config.20120627
http://info.gowasabi.net/commotion-openwrt/openwrt/atheros-ar2315.minimal.config
http://info.gowasabi.net/commotion-openwrt/openwrt/bin/atheros/
http://info.gowasabi.net/commotion-openwrt/openwrt/bin/atheros-ar2315-minimal/

Note these images have a pre-set root password r0ot56c0MM0t10N .

Follow-up question: how much RAM does your Dragino have?  The 16MB version
would have a hard time running anything besides stripped-down Commotion,
but it looks like a 32MB version is available too.

The 'minimal' config files referenced above were my attempts to compile
Commotion to fit within 16MB RAM.  Images compiled with this config will
mesh and broadcast APs, but they are missing the luci web UI and the splash
page.

I have no idea how well supported it is in android, but would using IPv6
for the mesh be better for avoiding address collision? The private
address space for IPv6 is undoubtedly large enough to avoid address
collision with any significant probability.

And just as a note, Commotion uses the 5.0.0.0/8 block for mesh
addresses. However, I'm not sure what this particular subnet was chosen.

Maybe because it was freed at some time? It appears to be allocated to
RIPE nowadays:
  http://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv4-address-space/ipv4-address-space.xml
who has started allocating out of it. So it will conflict with actual,

IPv6 in a non-Internet connected network is probably a good choice.

One thing to be careful about (for Internet-connected meshes), is
that IPv6 connectivity is far from ubiquituous: the node(s) on the mesh
that connect to the Internet might not be able to route IPv6, for
example because their ISPs don't support it yet -- this should become
less of an issue over time. Hopefully that's already taken into account
by the mesh routing protocol.

Maybe more awkwardly, IPv6 and IPv4 are actually more like two separate
technologies when it comes to connectivity: the same way that at some
point in time you could access the Internet over IPX and over IPv4 (I'm
showing my age..), nowadays you can access it using IPv6 and IPv4, but
the two shall not meet easily.  The best bet is still to have a
dual-stack, which doesn't completely eliminate issues, especially if
availability/resilience of one protocol might differ from the one for the
other protocol (for example bad IPv6 connectivity but good IPv4
connectivity, with a client that tries IPv6 first, which is normally the
case).

Finally, I don't know about serval, but my experience with IPv6 and IPv4
and VoIP is that most stacks do not handle both together well; I'm not
even talking about creepy situations where signaling might use one and
media the other. >:)

I have links to the patches that I submitted for the Linux kernel to
make authsae possible over adhoc networks. The change is a rather modest
two lines and was accepted into the kernel months ago. If you are
running compat-wireless or a recent kernel you probably already have the
change. Otherwise, you can look here:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/jberg/mac80211.git;a=commit;h=3bfda62c50b0a4b118dcfce36686508ca2892292

As for the authsae patches, I submitted them to the Cozybit developers.
They suggested improvements/changes and we went back and forth several
times. We stopped going down that path because we decided that it would
ultimately be better to integrate authsae directly with wpa_supplicant
so that we would not need to add an extra binary into Commotion. But, if
you are curious, you can look here:
https://github.com/hawkinswnaf/authsae

Fortunately, the cozybit people already have a ""custom"" wpa_supplicant
with authsae support. Yet, that's not the end of the issue. The signal
that they used to trigger an authsae handshake was not available for
adhoc nodes. That recently changed. Within the last week there was a
kernel patch that will allow us to grab a signal when a new peer adhoc
node is available for authentication. This means that we'll have an
easier time integrating authsae for mesh in wpa_supplicant.

I hope this information helped provide a little bit of background about
what we are working on with authsae. It's a pretty long-winded way of
saying, ""we're working on it"". :-)  Let me know your thoughts!

Talk to you soon!

951,Commotion-dev, Unifying Serval and Commotion Mesh,"Thu, 20 Dec 2012 07:01:53 +1030",+1030,Paul Gardner-Stephen,"Hi All,

>From a Serval perspective, we chose to stick with IPv4 for a few reasons:

1. IPv4 headers are smaller, which on limited bandwidth is always a
good thing, especially when you start passing around lots of addresses
to manage your topology.
2. At a global scale 64 bits of host address in IPv6 is actually a bit
marginal for avoiding collisions among randomly self-allocated
addresses.  This is more of a concern for networks consisting of very
mobile devices, such as phones.  Overall, it can probably be managed.
3. IPv6 adds overhead without actually solving some of the more
important problems, such as preventing address spoofing, really
avoiding address collisions, and allowing easy end-to-end encryption.
Our view is that a public-key based overlay is a better solution,
which is why we have created one.  We dealt with the long-address
problem by baking in address abbreviation, so that the shortest unique
prefix of each address is used, reducing overhead to sub-IPv4 levels
in many cases, and combined overlay+IPv4 overhead to less than IPv6
overhead.
4. IPv6 is not available on all devices we wish to support, e.g., some
Symbian phones, Windows Mobile phones, and very likely some Android
phones.  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_IPv6_support_in_operating_systems.
5. We are creating digital packet radio interfaces for long-range
meshing that will have insufficient bandwidth to support IPv6
overhead.

Of course, for Serval the equation is a little different, because
routing traditional TCP/IP traffic is not our highest priority.

I should add that some of our team is more sympathetic to IPv6 than I
am, and that we don't see a problem with making use of IPv6 when it is
available, but, personally, I am somewhat reluctant to rely on it, and
harbor concerns about the increased overhead, at least unless some
sort of address abbreviation is used in the routing protocols (which
maybe it already is by now).

Yes, that would be quite feasible, and is something that we have
thought about doing for a while.

The main ingredient needed would be ""Reliable MDP"", i.e., a TCP-like
reliable stream service to complement the UDP-like MDP.  This would be
quite feasible, but to do it right would take some effort. Naively
implementing TCP semantics is probably not the right solution.  It
probably makes sense to incorporate some of the Network Coding (see
http://www.mit.edu/~medard/papers2011/Modeling%20Network%20Coded%20TCP.pdf)
in this, so that packet loss doesn't get interpreted as congestion.

In the meanwhile, we do have an unofficial HTTP interface to Rhizome
that can be leveraged and extended to provide some internet-connected
services in the meantime. That interface is probably better for
providing off-grid content, and we have plans to implement distributed
content/learning management systems on this at some point.

I've updated / added the following wiki pages to record my progress in
getting Commotion-OpenWRT nodes under VirtualBox and VMware Player to work
with real USB wifi adapters.  The idea is that a virtual Commotion node
would be more convenient for rapid testing / development cycles than
testing directly on the target device.  Do note these virtual nodes are not
useful for performance testing (e.g. wireless reception / throughput); that
would still require the target hardware.

Note that VirtualBox is far less robust than VMware in attaching USB
peripherals to VM guests, so you may likely have to use VMware.  Likewise,
both VirtualBox and VMware will only simulate guests compiled for the x86
platform, although that does not appear to affect function of the
compat-wireless drivers.

Please do respond with your experiences and ideas about using virtual
Commotion nodes for testing and development, or suggested edits to the wiki
pages cited above.  I am planning to assemble suites of automated test
vectors that may be executed on these virtual nodes, with goal of reducing
complexity of the required testing environment (e.g. not every tester needs
a Nanostation M2 on hand).

P.S. Happy new year!

960,Commotion-dev, MeshTether to the Play Store,"Fri, 4 Jan 2013 19:07:15 -0500",-0500,Hans of Guardian,"
Are there any plans for getting MeshTether in the Google Play Store?  I think that could be a good way to get a lot of testers.  It should be listed with a fair amount of caveats, but it certainly would be a fast to find out which devices it works on.

I don't think the risk of it damaging phones is high at all.  Mostly the risk is that we'll get a fair amount of negative feedback because it won't work on most devices (i.e. Samsung).

961,Commotion-dev, Unifying Serval and Commotion Mesh (Paul,"Fri, 4 Jan 2013 19:36:58 -0500",-0500,stoker,"Thanks Eric for pulling SPAN into the conversation. I'm a bit late to
the party but thanks to Seamus I'm finally subscribed to the
commotion-dev mailing list.

SPAN is a framework for mesh network experimentation on the Android
platform (iOS support is also in the works). Don't be turned off by
the ""experimentation"" aspect - SPAN is quite functional. We like to
express that SPAN is constantly being advanced and we're very open to
new ideas.

Here's a high-level breakdown for those who aren't familiar with SPAN:

- We have an Manet Service and associated API that allows apps to turn
ad-hoc mode on and off, configure various network settings
programmatically and through a config file, query the network status
and routing information, and return a list of reachable peers. Also,
the device can be configured connect to traditional network
infrastructure via the cell chip or a secondary wireless network
adapter.

- We have a simple Manet Manager UI for configuring the network and
starting / stopping ad-hoc mode. We're working on allowing user to
share the app and config info by physically bumping phones (NFC).

- We have a simple mesh network visualizer app developed using
Processing for Android.

- We use standard Linux tools such as ifconfig, iwconfig, and iptables
to configure the wireless network adapter. As long as apps use the
right IP address they do not need to use the Manet Service API or be
modified in any way to make use of the ad-hoc network.

- Currently we support OLSR, but are not tied to any particular
routing protocol. We're interested in supporting reactive protocols to
cut down on network chatter. We like the idea of remaining as silent
as possible until you need to send data; however, complete silence
doesn't seem possible because at a minimum beacon frames will be sent
out and handled by the MAC layer.

- We're in the process of using tinc to create P2P VPN network
overlays on top of the mesh and using the openssl library to support a
variety of encryption algorithms.

- Public keys will be side-loaded or shared by physically bumping
phones with peers. Key pairs will also be generated on the device.
We'll support X.509 certs if users have a CA. The Manet Manager will
provide a convenient UI for sharing and managing keys and certs.

Here's a list of some of the things we want to stay away from:

- Being tied to a custom routing or mesh networking protocol. Custom
solutions often work very well and have their merits, but as a mesh
experimentation framework we'd like our protocols to be plug-and-play
if possible. Wouldn't it be great if there was a common API for
interacting with such protocols? It would be even better if they
worked transparently. That's why we're leaning towards a global device
proxy that intercepts all outgoing and incoming packets and sends them
to our Manet Service for mesh-related processing.

- Data interception and MITM attacks. The idea of sending your public
key over the open air without a pre-existing authentication mechanism
presents an opportunity for identify spoofing and a MITM attack.
That's why we plan on sharing keys via side-loading or a phone bump.
Also, broadcasting data packets makes it relatively simple to sniff
those packets without placing a malicious device in promiscuous mode
or monitor mode. We'd like to encapsulate full IP packets + headers in
VPN tunnel mode. Also, we'd like to encrypt the routing protocol
traffic itself to prevent malicious entities from manipulating the
network topology and perform DoS attacks.

Some things of note:

- SPAN provides a generic ad-hoc enabler - that is, if your device is
rooted, your wireless chipset driver module supports ad-hoc mode, and
your kernel supports wireless extensions (wext). Devices with Broadcom
chips work the best - about half the time the kernel or module code
needs to be slightly modified or built with new kernel options. It's
not our goal to customize a kernel for each Android device out there.
It would be great if there was a way to roll in the necessary kernel
modifications into CyanogenMod or the like, but the device-specific
nature of those customizations makes that relatively difficult. Also,
it seems that CyanogenMod's intention is to stay as ""vanilla"" as
possible and to focus kernel changes on performance and stability
improvements.

- We modified the pttdroid app. to get group voice chat working over
the mesh. The intent is to provide a simple replacement for
traditional push-to-talk (PTT) land mobile radios (LMRs) in a close /
moderate range environment. The app. is very simple - it's not
session-based and uses UDP, which works well in a mesh where people go
in and out of range at will. Using the app. you can see what other
peers are in the network, talk to them individually, create groups of
them, or passively listen for all incoming communications. The app.
doesn't support SIP or connect to a VOIP gateway.

This sounds great, definitely a lot of overlap in missions and ripe for collaboration.  A couple quick questions:

* do you have APKs that we can try?

* are you able to get Samsungs into adhoc mode?

* do you make Android itself aware of the status of the wifi device? I.e. can you see the IP, SSID, etc. in the Wifi Settings.

Any outcome that brings us to better support for ad hoc would be great. Blame and shame is one method.
The app should have a pointer to a wiki, with blacklist, whitelist and howto for enabling ad hoc.
We can easily get custom mod's on whitelist, by just pushing our fixes upstream.

We're currently in the process of getting our apps posted to Google

""builds"" folder in each project repo.

As mentioned above, in order for the Manet Service to flip your device
in ad-hoc mode:

- your device must be rooted
- your wireless chipset driver must support ad-hoc mode
- your kernel must support wireless extensions (wext)

We successfully got SPAN to work on the following devices:

- Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1
- Samsung Galaxy Nexus (custom kernel)
- Samsung Galaxy S II 4G Epic Touch
- ASUS Transformer Prime (custom kernel)
- ASUS Nexus 7 (custom kernel)

We've done most of our testing on the Samsung Galaxy Nexus. We posted
our custom kernels here:
https://github.com/monk-dot/SPAN/tree/master/kernels

You can install the kernel zips using ClockworkMod Recovery.

Some Samsung devices require custom kernel tweaks to work properly.
Sometimes it's as simple as adding ad-hoc mode back to the list of
supported wireless modes. Let us know which devices you're having
trouble with and we might be able to help.

We flip the device in ad-hoc mode at the linux level, so the Android
framework isn't aware. As far as the framework is concerned the wifi
is turned off. Thus, an app can't use the framework's WifiManager to
determine if wifi is enabled. That's a problem that we haven't spent
time trying to solve yet. Do you guys have a solution?

I'm happy to see you got adhoc working on some Samsung devices.  For the goals
of Commotion MeshTether, custom kernels are not an option.  Do you have
documentation on the specific issues that block adhoc mode on the devices
where you used a custom kernel?  I ask because that is something that ideally
we'd like to address for a popular devices.

When setting up adhoc mode on the Linux level, do you disable the wifi on the
Android level?  This is what Serval does, but that doesn't work for MeshTether
since the goal is to provide transparent TCP/IP networking.  Many if not most
Android apps will check with Android whether the phone has a network
connection before trying to use it.  So if the mesh app first tells Android to
disable wifi, then uses the Linux tools to setup the network, Android will
report there is no networking, all apps using this check will think there is
no networking.

I was able to get this working in MeshTether by setting the network config in
both Android level and the Linux level.  Then the settings are in sync, and
Android will report them properly to apps that ask.

Last question from me: what kind of integration with Serval and MeshTether are
you interested in?  IMHO, I think it would be great if we all joined efforts
on the core bits, like an adhoc framework that includes the MethTether trick.
 Also olsrd/batmand/etc. wrapping code.

I believe the problem is that the kernels on Android 4.0.1+ devices
specifically have removed ad-hoc wifi support.  On those devices, an
updated kernel is the only option.

This could be streamlined by enabling MeshTether/ServalMesh/SPAN to
pull kernels off the net and install them, without having to get
clockwork recovery or other tools specifically -- i.e., make it
trivial for an end user to do.

>From a Serval perspective, I see the following strengths that might be
leveraged in a combined ad-hoc management application, taking the best
from each:

1. SPAN has specific interest in enabling ad-hoc as a goal unto itself
(whereas Serval and MeshTether/Commotion need ad-hoc mode as an
enabler for their core business)
2. Serval Mesh probably has the widest general handset support, and a
framework for adding scripts to support new handsets without
reinstalling the APK.
3. MeshTether has the trick for letting Android know that a network is
available.

I am sure that there are other advantages that each has, but it seems
to me that there are strengths in each that are worth combining into a
single Android ad-hoc management app.  Such a combined app would
probably give us leverage for inclusion in CyanogenMod and other
custom ROMs, as well as for encouraging Google/Android to do something
more definite about ad-hoc support in Android.

kernels, but I believe that in doing so there will be certain devices
which you simply cannot support. One solution might be to pre-compile
your own wireless kernel module driver and insmod / rmmod it as
necessary.

We don't have documentation on the device-specific issues, but I just
compiled the following list for you:


Ad-hoc mode support is disabled on the Galaxy Nexus CDMA/LTE 4G AOSP
4.0.2 ICS kernel (android-omap-tuna-3.0-mr0.1)

Add NL80211_IFTYPE_ADHOC back into supported interface modes list:

/drivers/net/wireless/bcmdhd/wl_cfg80211.c

static struct wireless_dev *wl_alloc_wdev(struct device *sdiofunc_dev) {
	// ?
	wdev->wiphy->interface_modes =
		BIT(NL80211_IFTYPE_STATION) | BIT(NL80211_IFTYPE_ADHOC)
		| BIT(NL80211_IFTYPE_AP) | BIT(NL80211_IFTYPE_MONITOR);
	// ...
}



Ad-hoc mode support is disabled on the Nexus 7 AOSP 4.1.2 JB kernel
(android-tegra3-grouper-3.1-jb-mr0)

Add NL80211_IFTYPE_ADHOC back into supported interface modes list:

/drivers/net/wireless/bcmdhd/wl_cfg80211.c

static s32 wl_setup_wiphy(struct wireless_dev *wdev, struct device
*sdiofunc_dev)
{
	// ...
	wdev->wiphy->interface_modes =
		BIT(NL80211_IFTYPE_STATION) | BIT(NL80211_IFTYPE_ADHOC)
		| BIT(NL80211_IFTYPE_AP) | BIT(NL80211_IFTYPE_MONITOR);
	// ...
}



Ad-hoc mode is disabled on the Samsung Galaxy S III GSM SGH-i747 ICS kernel

Add NL80211_IFTYPE_ADHOC back into supported interface modes list:

/drivers/net/wireless/bcmdhd/src/wl/sys/wl_cfg80211.c

static s32 wl_setup_wiphy(struct wireless_dev *wdev, struct device
*sdiofunc_dev)
{
	// ...
	wdev->wiphy->interface_modes =
		BIT(NL80211_IFTYPE_STATION) | BIT(NL80211_IFTYPE_ADHOC)
		| BIT(NL80211_IFTYPE_AP) | BIT(NL80211_IFTYPE_MONITOR);
	// ...
}


Yes, like Serval we also disable the wifi at the Android level.

SPAN's interest goes beyond enabling ad-hoc mode. We're interested in
providing a secure and transparent ad-hoc networking capability on the
Android and iOS platform. We're also interested in developing
mesh-aware apps, such as group voice chat and bit-torrent-like data
sharing.

I think that single ad-hoc management service would be best. We have a
management app that's simply a UI which makes calls to the service.
The advantage of a service over an app is that:
- other apps can send commands to it to start / stop the mesh
- other apps configure the MANET programmatically
- other apps can query the service for mesh-related information, like
a peer listing
- it can be configured to automatically restart if it's killed by the
Android platform (it will also run longer than an app before being
killed)

Apps which make use of the SPAN Manet Service simply make calls to a
ManetHelper class that's packaged in a JAR library. Those apps can
then implement the ManetObservable interface and register for event
callbacks when the peer listing changes, the device switches out of
ad-hoc mode, etc. Note that apps don't need to use the service to use
the ad-hoc network. The service provides a tool for mesh-aware apps.

Both SPAN and Serval are based on the Wireless Tether for Root Users
app. so there's probably a lot of overlap in the way we flip the
device into ad-hoc mode.

Hi Hans,

afaik there is no specific documentation regarding the blocking of ad-hoc mode on the devices that use a custom kernel, obviously only in the specific case that NO custom kernel is used...
Everything is simply based on testing on the devices themselves... To be more specific : in our case we discovered that MeshTether simply did not work anymore when we received our new test-devices (Samsung Galaxy Nexus). Beforehand MeshTether did work on an older device (HTC Desire running android 2.3) and on some older tablets (Samsung Tabs running Android 3.2). 
We discovered for example that some custom kernel's (like the Franco kernel for the GNex) actually made it possible to flip the wifi-chipset in ad-hoc mode on our new test device... In the end it's as simple as this :
- from android 4.x.x the used kernels do not support wext (wireless extensions) by default, which makes results in not being able to flip the chip in adhoc mode (just as stoker mentioned in his post)...

>From your accounts it sounds as if MeshTether is able to do that : so I was simply curious if you had a chance to run MesTether and/or setting the network config on a 4.x.x device, and have seen that working as well ?
Unfortunately the situation is changed since ICS, so I was wondering if your experiences are based on pre-ICS or if you had everything up and running on a non-rooted, non custom-kernel running device ?

Also a question for stoker : do you also have the ""customized"" ptttdroid app hosted somewhere so that we could test it as well ? Also do you have the multicast (via UDP) mode running ? The standard version actually crashes whenever multicast is selected instead of broadcast...

Here's a link to the Manet Voice Chat app. based on pttdroid:
https://github.com/ProjectSPAN/android-manet-ptt/tree/master/builds

It took a little tinkering to get multicast working in the original
pttdroid app. As you said, it doesn't work out of the box. I should
not that the Manet Voice Chat app. doesn't use multicast at this time.

While the Manet Voice Chat app. does support group chat, it actually
opens up a UDP socket to each individual peer rather than a multicast
socket. I'm not a multicast guru, but using multicast in a mesh seems
to present a few problems:

- The official ipv4 multicast address range is 224.0.0.0 through
239.255.255.255. I'm not sure what will happen if you try to use an
address outside this range. It probably won't work. What if the mesh
subnet is 192.168.11.x? How would you setup a multicast group inside
that subnet? Maybe you don't need to.

- How do peers in your group know which multicast address to use? How
would we ensure that no other groups are using the same multicast
address? We might need to implement some sort of multicast address
resolution handshake system.

- How would multicast work over P2P VPN links? With tinc, a tun
interface is created for each link. If peer A has a link to peer B,
and a separate link to peer C, it's easiest for A to open a separate
socket for B and C. An alternative idea is to create VPN subnets or
groupings overlaying the mesh, and broadcast voice packets within the
subnet, but then the question becomes a matter of how those subnets
are created on-the-fly as new groups are created.

These are open questions we're still thinking about. Any ideas?

Distributing via F-Droid is very simple.

The way that F-Droid works (as I understand it) is that they build all
of their apks from source as a way of ensuring that the software is
indeed distributing all the needed code to build.

Adding apps to F-Droid consists of cloning their repo from gitorious,
editing or creating a meta data file and then asking the maintainers to
review and pull your changes.

I did this once to get Orweb into F-Droid, and would be happy to do it
again for Commotion, or walk others through the process.

Best,
~~Nat

I remember testing it with multicast, on WiFi-Direct. No multihop, 
other than via soft-AP. Maybe mcast route was missing in your setup.
(check default or 224/4 to wlan0)

I planned to test olsr with bmf plugin. It should work, I think.

Then, it is not IPv4 multicast :-)

Source IP address is your configured address, in this subnet. Mcast 
addresses are destinations only.

Multicast addresses are by definition application specific. Similar to
TV channel (which was tuning on a frequency setting).

This needs out-of-band hints. Could be URL, NFC of use a keyboard.

Random addresses and UDP port numbers would not collide that much.
Crypto would help to guarantee something.
Current PTT users have procedures for channel selection. Often, there 
are much less channels than ""private"" mcast IP addresses (239/8).

Yes.
Or just use a dictionary.

The OLSR BMF plugin can run in pseudo-broadcast mode. And still use
MPR flooding. We need to patch the MPR problem in olsrd. It is 
disabled because ETX link metics. Plan is to have it fixed in OLSRv2 
release.
(BMF is non-selective, thus broadcast type of distribution)

I don't like the crypto tunnels, too much overhead and addressing 
problems. If crypto is needed, just crypt payload. Use transport mode
or something similar.

More ideas than solutions....

Source IP address is your configured address, in this subnet. Mcast 
addresses are destinations only.

Multicast addresses are by definition application specific. Similar 
to TV channel (which was tuning on a frequency setting, for 
selecting a TV channel).

This needs out-of-band hints. Could be URL, NFC or a keyboard strokes.

Random addresses and UDP port numbers would not collide that much.
Crypto would help to guarantee something.
Current PTT users have procedures for channel selection. Often, there 
are much less channels than ""private"" mcast IP addresses (239/8).

Yes.
Or just use a directory.

The OLSR BMF plugin can run in pseudo-broadcast mode. And still use
MPR flooding. We need to patch the MPR problem in olsrd. It is 
disabled because ETX link metics. Plan is to have it fixed in OLSRv2 
release.
(BMF is non-selective, thus broadcast type of distribution)

I don't like the crypto *tunnels*, too much overhead and addressing 
problems. If crypto is needed, just crypt payload. Use transport mode
or something similar.

More ideas than solutions....

I've have to catch up getting my test phone up and running. I'll connect

I just recently checked in a new version of the Commotion-OpenWRT branch
for ath5k, but with kernel v3.3.8 and compat-wireless-2012-09-07 backported

Sounds great -- will give it a try.

Do you want to give it a try pulling in the package for building
servald as part of the image (optional module initially)?  My feeling
is that we will want this at some point anyway, and now is as good a
time as any.

As Andrew mentioned in previous emails, we have partnered with a local
organization to help us create a physical laboratory testbed for doing
performance and Q/A testing on Commotion.

The testbed consists of several RF-isolating enclosures connected
together with a special RF switch. Each enclosure contains a single
Ubiquity Picostation running Commotion. Wireless connections (and their
quality) among the Commotion nodes are determined by the RF switch. We
have deployed 8 nodes in this environment.

The enclosures are made by Ramsey and the RF Switch is made by JFW
Industries
(http://www.jfwindustries.com/catalog/Programmable_Attenuator_Assemblies_19_Rack-48-1.html).


The RF switch is programmed with a series of XML documents. These XML
documents can represent either
a) Literal attenuation values for the RF signal between nodes, or
b) ""Geographic"" location of nodes in 2D space where attenuation values
are determined using a freespace loss model.

The following is an example of an XML document that configures the
switch with literal attentuation values (a):

Abandoned dishes like this one are practically a dime a dozen here in St.
Louis.  So many apartment tenants sign up satellite TV, and then abandon
it.  Frequently, the landlords are more than happy to let you remove the
orphaned equipment for free.

This is great.

The Serval Mesh app (which is about to get a HEAVY update) also offers
some APIs, but probably mostly in complementary areas to your Manet
Manager.  We will endeavour to take a look at your apps soon.

With regard to handset support, it might be worth taking a look at our
handset detection and support code
(https://github.com/servalproject/batphone), as we have already built
support for a number of other handsets, and an automatic guessing
engine that can build support scripts for some new handsets it
encounters.  It's not perfect, but it may be useful to incorporate
into Manet Manager.

We look forward to trying out the Serval Mesh app update. The current
app supports a number of features, including text chat, placing calls,
sharing files, and mapping. Does your team have plans to separate each
of those features out into separate app? I believe that will make
matters simpler from a developer's as well as from a user's
perspective.

Thanks for pointing us to your handset detection and support code.
Since both of our projects are using the edify approach, I believe it
won't be difficult to integrate our code. However, I believe that it
would be best for the Commotion team to integrate all of our
mesh-enabling code into their Mesh Tether app.

As I see it, there are three kinds of devices that the teams are
primarily targeting:
- devices which support wext and can be put into ad-hoc mode without
kernel mods (Serval)
- devices which don't support wext and can be put into ad-hoc mode
without kernel mods (Commotion)
- devices which require kernel mods (SPAN)

I believe we'd all like to see one app which can support all three. I
believe that the Commotion team is best suited for the task
considering their focus and large developer base. More developers
means a wider array of devices to test on and more long-term support.

Maps is already a separate app for this reason.  However, the calling,
text messaging and file exchange are all based on the core Serval
protocols, and past experience has shown that having (at least the
core function of) those in separate apps that require installation is
disadvantageous, because they are naturally closely coupled, calls and
MeshMS in particular.  The Rhizome protocol that facilitates the file
sharing is used under the hood to power MeshMS and software updates as
well as regular file exchange.

I totally agree. We would love to see a single app that just provides
ad-hoc wifi and the related functions, and has wide support as you
envisage.

The Manet Manager app has an integrated Manet Service that lets other
apps configure the network through an API call. Another app can create
a ManetConfig object, set all of the parameters, and pass it down to
the service. It's optional. A user can also configure the mesh through
the Manet Manager UI.

I understand your use of scripts. Under the hood both the Manet
Manager and Serval Mesh apps use edify scripts to detect devices and
configure them for ad-hoc mode. The apps execute the edify scripts in
a native process. The edify scripts provide some additional Android
functions versus shell scripts, such as loading/unloading the wifi
module. When the Manet Manager needs to execute other native commands
with elevated privileges (like starting olsrd) it writes those
commands to a script on the fly and executes the script with su.

Creating a set of scripts and limiting their access to the Manet
Manager / Serval Mesh app in a custom ROM is an interesting idea.
We've thought about creating a ROM where the Manet Manager would be a
system app and therefore have advanced privileges and not be randomly
killed off by the performance manager.

I highly encourage updating / branching CyanogenMod. Certain devices
require certain modifications to enable wext support and enable ad-hoc
mode. At this time my team doesn't have a large enough developer base
to make custom modifications to each CyanogenMod kernel, so it's a
task we haven't addressed. Maybe it would be best to select one device
at first and go from there? If that's the case, I support choosing the
Galaxy Nexus or Nexus 7.

As CyanogenMod seems to be using github these days, it would make it
much easier to implement something like this.  It would require some
committed developer resource to progressively target various devices.
I fear that it might be a perpetual game of catch up to make the ROMs,
and there is a question of cost-effectiveness.

This is why Serval has been thinking for a while now about making a
mesh helper device instead.  Basically, people keep using their
existing android (or other platform phone), and it associates to the
mesh helper as a WiFi client, and they run only a ""normal"" non-root
application on their phone.

The mesh helper simultaneously runs a WiFi AP and ad-hoc interface,
thus offloading the ad-hoc WiFi from the phone where support is hard,
but also reducing the power requirements for the user's phone, because
client mode is more energy efficient than ad-hoc mode.  The helper
device would itself be mobile-phone hardware derived, as this is the
cheapest way to make it.

Another nice thing about the helper device is that one helper can be
shared by a number of people in its range. It can also serve up the
APKs for the various mesh applications that people might want to use.

We are also planning that the mesh helper device should have an
Arduino or similar built in, so that we can add arbitrary RF front
ends to allow long-range mesh communications.  For example in
countries where the ISM 915MHz band is available (USA, AU, NZ, ZA,
Israel and a number of others, but not Europe), we can use a HopeRF
RFM23BP to transmit at 1W with a simple wave form at 128kbit/sec,
gaining approximately 25db -- 29db over 2.4GHz WiFi, resulting in 16x
- 30x range compared with WiFi.

We have some initial funding from NLnet Foundation to prototype this
using Draginos, and have made some progress, and once we have a few
other blocking tasks out the way, will begin to work on integrating an
RFM23BP as a 915MHz frontend.  See the following URL for some
information on what we have been doing and plan to do over the next
few months:

My experience with this showed that having the root password set by default

I've been busy trying out backports to the current Commotion-OpenWRT
codebase to incorporate the newer v3.3.8 kernel on all platforms (ar71xx,
atheros, and x86), along with updated radio drivers from
compat-wireless-2012-09-07.  These backports were adapted from the current
'Atttitude Adjustment v12.09' branch of OpenWRT, and they would have been
near impossible to create without help from VirtualBox/VMware.

It is expected that the newer kernel, and especially the newer radio
drivers, will yield noticeable speed and stability improvements!

Here are the branches in the Commotion git repo, where I had been
collecting the various patches needed to apply these backports.  If you
wish to build images from these repos, you will likely need to do a 'make
dirclean' to clear out old binaries!

https://code.commotionwireless.net/projects/commotion-openwrt/repository/show?rev=ath9k_new
https://code.commotionwireless.net/projects/commotion-openwrt/repository/show?rev=ath5kMinimal_new
https://code.commotionwireless.net/projects/commotion-openwrt/repository/show?rev=x86_new

Next, here are pre-compiled image that I made today.  The default root
password on these images is r0ot56c0MM0t10N , but you should also be able
to use the sysupgrade tool to re-flash your nodes in-place, and preserve
their existing configuration.

http://info.gowasabi.net/commotion-openwrt-new/
http://info.gowasabi.net/commotion-openwrt-new/openwrt/bin/ar71xx/
http://info.gowasabi.net/commotion-openwrt-new/openwrt/bin/atheros/
http://info.gowasabi.net/commotion-openwrt-new/openwrt/bin/atheros-ar2315-minimal/
http://info.gowasabi.net/commotion-openwrt-new/openwrt/bin/x86/

I've tried my best to verify these images work on my end, and that they can
be drop-in replacements for the current version of Commotion.  However, I
would still recommend first flashing a node where you have access to its
reset button, just in case.

The 'minimal' images referred to above are my best attempt to compile for
low-memory devices like a FONera.  *However*, do be warned that OpenWRT
devs insist the v3.3+ kernel will *not* run reliably under 16MB of RAM.
Indeed my own attempt at flashing a FONera just yielded kernel errors from
insufficient memory.  It may finally be time to put those FONeras and
pre-802.11n Nanostations out to pasture.

The purpose of making these images is to let the Commotion community at
large benefit from kernel and radio driver improvements right now, while
giving the firmware developers time to upgrade Commotion-OpenWRT itself to
support the new netifd API in OpenWRT v12.09.

Finally, and w.r.t. to stability improvements, I would recommend trying the
new images for these support requests that were filed over the past few
months.

https://code.commotionwireless.net/issues/330
https://code.commotionwireless.net/issues/342
https://code.commotionwireless.net/issues/403

Ideally, if everyone's testing goes well, these backports can be merged
into the master Commotion-OpenWRT branch!

OpenWRT by default has no root password set, expecting you first telnet in
to set the password.  This doesn't seem to play nicely with the automated
configuration that the meshconfig tool tries to do.  I had thought that
compiling in a default root password into images did not change the (lack

Yeah, a hard problem.

Ideally you generate one initially and display it on some LCD once ;-)

The problem that I see with having the password a well known default password is that usually people forget to change it. Search engines then find those devices on the internet. And they are sort of p0wned by definition then :)

Well.... I did discover some openwrts in the wild which are default, unconfigured and once you greet them with a telnet login attempt, they will greet you back with a prompt (""#"") sign. No password required. Yikes.


Personally I recommend the following:
Step 1: an unconfigured mesh node generates a random password
Step 2: it connects to some central server and fetches its configuration.
Step 3: It reconfigures itself based on the configuration stored in the nodeDB. The user can change the pwd from a nodeDB/dashboard.

(I know this conflicts with the totally distributed approach of commotion, but that's how we will do it initially with our new nodeDB at Funkfeuer)

That's one way to do it. ssh keys are a different one. X509 certificates also come to mind.
I am open to better suggestions.

So, whenever the DR1 release candidate is assembled into a coherent whole,
if the underlying OS doesn't already have the kernel and radio drivers from
Attitude Adjustment, then these backports may work on that too:

My original motivation for creating the backports was that the
compat-wireless drivers included with the version of Commotion pinned to
trunk r31639 didn't work very well with the ath9k_htc USB wifi adapters I'd
been using.  That, and the fact that I too had a personal copy of Attitude

tangential to Commotion.

Perhaps one day everyone's secret copies of Attitude Adjustment will be

Using an external radio for longer range ad hoc connections makes 
sense. Question is how to connect the smartphone to such device. I'm
not so sure WiFi AP is the right solution. The helper acting as AP 
would be power hungry, where the smartphone as station can use the

I still like the wlan ad hoc mode, for short range / high data rate.

But remember that the helper device can actually have a larger battery.
Also, AP mode is still less power hungry than ad-hoc mode on most hardware.
We would need to investigate all this more thoroughly.

As do we.

Actually, ad-hoc consumes almost as much power listening as it does
transmitting, due to the waveforms used in WiFi.

> Do you use the RF22 mesh protocol?

No. We are creating a new protocol that we call ""multi-threaded radio""
and is designed with the frequency hopping requirements of the ISM915
band in mind.

Once synchronised (which has some interesting but solvable
challenges), then the radios will follow the same sequence of channels
to listen on, with a channel dwell time of 1ms - 2ms, and a bit rate
of 128kbit.

Each radio will only listen on 1/4 of the slots, reducing RX duty
cycle to 25%, reducing energy consumption.  Even when listening,
energy consumption will be much lower than WiFi due to the simpler
waveform decoding.

When a radio hears a packet for itself, it keeps listening on the same
channel to receive the whole packet.  This will likely be ~10s of ms.
Meanwhile, the other nodes will have hopped along to other channels to
listen if there is any traffic for them.  Thus we can get 128kbit on
each channel, with many channels carrying traffic at the same time.
Or at least that is the theory, we will find out when we get to
implement it :)

For the past few months, I've been using a heavily modified derivative of
Commotion-OpenWRT on Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH units which I use as gateway
routers in WasabiNet.  These units happen to have a USB port, which works
just fine and dandy under OpenWRT, both for USB peripherals and mounting
USB disks (presumably both solid state or HD).

I'm using these USB ports to monitor APC battery back-up supplies on the
gateway routers, but that's pretty boring.  I've tried asking a couple
times at the hacker space here in St. Louis what neat uses folks may have
for a USB port on their Internet router, e.g. file server, or miscellaneos
remote control, but the interest there hasn't been strong.

The Buffalo routers are neat, but even neater looks to be this 40$US unit,
a TP-Link TL-MR3020 :
http://www.microcenter.com/product/379216/Portable_3G-375G_Wireless-N_Router

I do believe Musti was showing off something similar to this at the IS4CWN
last year.  Don't let the '3G connectivity' nonsense distract you; this is
a cute little 802.11n ath9k-based radio with a USB port, and it looks like
it will run OpenWRT with some encouragement.  Furthermore, a 2nd USB port
can be had with some soldering and elbow grease.
http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-mr3020

Likewise, the TL-WR703N is an equivalent unit:
http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr703n

What could this USB port do for you?

- Filesystem for squid proxy? (Probably not very practical)
- 3G/4G modem for Internet gateway?
- USB sound adapter for streaming MP3 applications?
- Control this desktop rocket launcher

With OLSR/OLSRv2, it is not possible to set the update rate on a link.
The originator of for example TC messages defines the rate. If it is
a higher frequency, e.g. mains powered router on high rate links, a next
hop link faces this high rate.

Yes, routing at middleware layer or proxy.
I assume these links are fall back. That would be try 1st end-to-end IP,
and fall back to these non-IP links when no IP path is available.

I just want to say that the mesh helper is a very cool idea. It
reminds me of the Persistent Systems Man Portable Unit (MPU):
http://www.persistentsystems.com/products_7a.php

Essentially the MPU acts as an AP which lets devices send data over
the Persistant Systems high powered long distance 2.4 / 5 GHz MANET.

A cheaper, open source, developer-friendly solution would be great.
Using an available ISM band for long distance comms makes sense.

Do check out the 2nd generation MeshPotato that VillageTelco are commissioning.
It is based on the same chipset, and has a USB port, and will come in
indoor and outdoor ready varieties.  See below for the announcement
yesterday from Steve Song from
https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/village-telco-mp20/TpceSRIiUr4

The main interesting points for me, apart from it being an
open-hardware project, and will come running OpenWRT, are the
relatively generous flash (16MB) and RAM (64MB), plus 11 exposed GPIO
lines.  We hope to use those to connect Arduinos connected to RF front
ends for long-range meshing as part of our mesh helper device project.

We have asked for 10 of the initial batch, and will be happy to try
flash images that people provide.

1025,Commotion-dev, DR1 Quickstart,"Wed, 23 Jan 2013 11:24:15 -0500",-0500,Seamus Tuohy,"Hello All,

A quick update on the quickstart interface I am putting together for
developer-release one. The quickstart is a ""on first boot"" interface
that walks a user through customizing a node. This is intended to make
the initial setup of a node trivial for a new user. The current version
is missing the ""one-button"" setup. This should be added by the start of
next week.

Version 001 of this quickstart was a ""mostly"" functional luci interface
which set the various configuration files on the node. Version 002 (the
current branch) only configures a nodeConf uci file which the upcoming
commotion daemon will use to configure the node at the conclusion of the
quickstart. As such, the current version will spend of its time
customizing uci files and making ubus calls to the commotion daemon to
fetch data.

You can find the controlling code at
https://github.com/opentechinstitute/commotion-quick-start/tree/Version02 .
If you want to run it you will have to also grab the www directory from
the main branch at
https://github.com/opentechinstitute/commotion-quick-start which
contains the icons, etc.

To put it on a router you simply copy the www folder into the main repo
directory (I will update the repo later today to include this) and then
scp it over to the routers root directory recursively. Once you have
done this you can go to IPADDRESS/cgi-bin/luci/QuickStart to start the
quickstart.

The whole quickstart configuration can be found in
/etc/config/quickstart. This contains one ""quickstart"" section titled
""options"" and multiple ""page"" sections. ""options"" holds the current and
last pages as well as a variable that controls weather the Quickstart
page is accessible. We disable it after completion because it allows
non-admin users to manipulate root level controls. A ""page"" contains
title that is either a number (this is how the controller iterates
through the quickstart) or a title that represents a side page.

Each page has set of title information for its display. The page also
contains a ""buttonText"" item that specifies the text to be placed on any
button that links to it in the quickstart. A ""page"" can contain up to
two lists. The first list is modules. This list pulls content to
populate the main section. In our quickstart I have separated most pages
to include only one content section. There is nothing to stop someone
from customizing a page that holds multiple content items. Modules call
a <modulename>Renderer function in the controller when the page is
initially rendered, and a <modulename>Parser function when data from a
page is submitted. This means that if you want your own module you
simple add it to a page and create a renderer and a parser function.
Renderer's send initial variables to the page and parsers process user
input and send back errors that possible occur in the page.They stack
quite well. Lastly a ""page"" can contain a button list. Buttons call
<buttonname>Button functions when pressed that load up side pages.
noBack and noNext buttons remove the auto-generated last and next
buttons to allow for specialized pages.

Lastly, when you get to the ""this node will reset page"" on version two
you will have to refresh your browser, as I have removed the actual
reset functionality from the quickstart to give more control to the
daemon. Refreshing the router here will take you to the next page.

We still have a ways to go on ""prettifying"" the quickstart and updating
the language, and I have yet to implement the ubus calls or to upload
the patches I have made to take over the captive portal. But, please let
me know any feedback you may have. I will send the updated ux map and
language when it finishes our current round of feedback.

Well, remember the Mesh Potato ran a full asterisk install on a 180MHz
MIPS, which is about as slow as any router.  So OpenBTS is not out of
the question.

Related to that, I would use it for connecting mass storage for
Rhizome caching.

Also, once we get the code written, to connect an Arduino+HopeRFM23BP
for long-range meshing.  We are going to try this with a pile of
TP-LINK WR703N's that we have.

I like to think of my Commotion network as a way to speak with my
neighbors, so I'd love to see a kind of profile device. I imagine the
smallest piece of hardware that could host a super simple page with a
standard set of profile information, and with easy-to-follow
instructions for how to load it up. This page would be advertised like a
service on the network, so you could click on it in the applications
list and it would open a page in a browser that tells you a little bit
about the node host (in this case, me).

It would basically present the social complement to the technical
information the router itself is broadcasting. Could be a short video, a
profile photo, and a few lines of text. An application on a client
device could pull the information and present it in a more pleasing
format, maybe something that looked like http://cassco.co/

Ideally, this would cost only marginally more than the router itself, so
every host could also participate as a presenter on the network. Many of
the things people are talking about in this thread are also acts of
self-expression, using different kinds of data or protocols. My ideal is
the one that speaks the most basic form of expression possible. So,
bonus points if an LED on the ""profile device"" flashes every time
someone views your profile, or if on the profile page was a button
someone could click to make the LED turn on and off.

1030,Commotion-dev, Throughput advantage to 802.11s support,"Tue, 5 Feb 2013 15:38:15 -0600",-0600,Ben West,"Hi All,

I'm happy to read that the Hackday just past went well!  The roadmap wiki
page<https://code.commotionwireless.net/projects/commotion/wiki/Hackday-Roadmap-Notes>looks
pretty dense, although unfortunately my suggestion would be to
increase its density by adding *802.11s support*.  My recent work to
extract Robin/Cloudtrax dashboard stuff into a standalone package was part
of a larger effort to get a modern replacement for a Robin nodes.  And,
this is what is now prompting my recommendation for 802.11s support.

Since I have the expectation of remotely re-flashing all the Robin nodes in
the field sometime soon, I did throughput tests for old vs new to make sure
I wouldn't be deploying a regression.  And, looks like 802.11g adhoc
meshing, even under Attitude Adjustment with the latest atheros drivers, is
*15% to 20% slower* than the ahdemo meshing done by Kamikaze+madwifi based
Robin firmware!  This performance penalty appears to come from the fact
adhoc mode require beacons, while ah-demo does not, hence it not being
supported by the 802.11 standard.  Furthermore, the mac80211 /
compat-wireless radio drivers currently packaged into OpenWRT appear to
enforce a maximum 1000ms interval for such beacons.

For 5.8GHz adhoc, a potential work-around is to use short slot-times as
implemented in this patch:

https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/1835531/

2.8GHz adhoc, however, must still use long slot times to remain
standards-compliant.  The work-around is that 802.11s meshing can use short
slot times, which this patch implements:

https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/2050741/

While I do admit that doing speed tests on near-obsolete platforms like
ath5k would normally yield diminishing returns, these slot-time
enhancements should apply just as well to ath9k, too.

1033,Commotion-dev, Serval Mesh Helper Device / ISM long-range meshing,"Thu, 7 Feb 2013 15:30:52 +1030",+1030,Paul Gardner-Stephen,"Hi All,

Just a heads up on some stuff we are doing at Serval that I think will
be of interest to Commotion deployments more generally.

We are now actively working on what we call our ""Mesh Helper Device"",
the prototype of which will consist of a TP-LINK WR703N running
Commotion OpenWRT + servald, connected to an RFD900 ISM 915MHz band
packet radio and a rechargeable battery.

This gives the potential for much greater range than just WiFi, as
well as offering some resistance for 2.4GHz jamming in places where
that is a problem.

The RFD900s with current firmware in urban settings offer 5x to 10x
range compared with WiFi.  For example, I could receive a decent
signal with one radio sitting on my lounge, and the other radio with
me walking around the block, up to about 150m away -- with the signal
path obliquely through perhaps 8 or 10 houses, fences, cats, dogs,
trees and everything else.

With good clear line of sight, and a low noise floor, ranges of 10km
or more are possible, with some evidence pointing to the actual limit
being around 80km - 120km in very ideal conditions.

We have already managed to get Serval Mesh traffic, including some
Rhizome transfers (but not yet voice) running over one of these links:

servalpaul.blogspot.com.au/2013/02/breaking-wifi-barrier-serval-mesh.html

We think a complete Mesh Helper Device, including these really nice
radios could be built and sell for <US$200.  It may also be possible
to use a cheaper compatible (but slightly lower performance) radio and
get the price down to <US$100.

The RFD900 firmware only does point-to-point communications, but it is
entirely possible to make it do ""ad-hoc"" point-to-multipoint
communications.  Perhaps this is something for us to look at as a
follow on after our current work block is complete.

We are hoping to have a couple of these with us in New Zealand in a
couple of weeks for the KiwiEx field trial. General outline of our
thinking for KiwiEx at present is at:

This sounds great. I would be quite interested in seeing what kind of

As for battery power, I've been experimenting with providing power to a

energy capacity per density/size than any other common consumer battery,
from my investigation. For the RPi, which uses 5V USB power, drawing
500-1000 mA, a couple alkaline D-cells could last 2-3 days. I bet this
could work for your Mesh Helper as well. All I needed to get that
working was a simple step-down DC-DC converter, which costs US$2 max. A
handful of D-cells aren't exactly pocket-sized, but certainly something

These sorts of units are quite interesting.  The range is in part due
to the +7.5db gain on the directional antennae at each end, and
perhaps more importantly, the front-to-back ratio that this affords to
help reject interference.  If they have done the band translation
""right"", then the spectral efficiency could well be better rather than
worse, as 900MHz has substantially better propagation characteristics,
and over typical distances yields about +9db compared with similar
2.4GHz transmissions.

900MHz NanoStations and similar would be a useful addition to a
Commotion network, and you (or we) may wish to obtain some to test
out, but there are a few caveats, some common to all 900MHz
communications, and some specific to a NanoStation type product:

1. The ISM 915 band is only available in the Americas, Australia, New
Zealand, Israel and a few other countries.
2. The regulations on the use of this band, and its frequency range
vary substantially even among those countries. For example the US
requires 50 channels in the hopping scheme, while Australia requires
only 20, but the band in the US is almost twice as wide.
3. The power consumption of the unit will be relatively high if
transmitting at 1W.  This is perhaps more an issue for Serval-inspired
use-cases where mains power is assumed to be absent.
4. The higher bit-rates that the unit will use (compared to what we
are experimenting with) will reduce the maximum range that can be
achieved.

This is why we are looking at a solution where the radio is field
replaceable with one that is legal wherever the unit is to be used. It
is also why we are looking at a hand-held portable device that you
just shove in your other pocket, and any phone within WiFi range can
make use of it.

I imagine that it shouldn't be hard to put OpenWRT on the 900MHz NanoStations.

Our focus at present is on long-range communications, in particular
for Rhizome bundle-oriented traffic.  As such we have done nothing as
yet to minimise latency and jitter.  Nonetheless, MDP pings have been
as low as a few hundred milliseconds.

>From a Commotion perspective, I would imagine that some of the more
interesting use-cases that come immediately to mind include (all
sitting on top of Serval Rhizome):

1. Distribution of updates to Commotion project and related software
2. A Twitter-like mesh-based micro-blogging service (possibly with a
gateway to Twitter itself)
3. Distribution of either introduced or locally produced news/content
4. Delivery of voicemail and SMS traffic between commotion OpenBTS's
and mesh nodes

Essentially it is best to think of it as a courier service between
nodes, like an inter-campus mail service, rather than a bulk real-time
transport. Of course, in many instances it can do better than that,
but this perspective will, I think, help with the exploration of the
kind of service that it can enable.

In principle up to about 128Kbit.  To really achieve that, we need to
rewrite the radio firmware, which needs to happen if we want them to
mesh, anyway. For now we are getting about 30Kbit, which is still
enough to do useful things with Rhizome (MeshMS, software updates,
voice-mail when we finish writing it, and other things).

It has two antennae connectors for diversity (but not MIMO), and I put
two antennae at 90 degrees on those to give some polarity diversity
and resilience, especially since we intend the thing to end up in
peoples pockets/desks/wherever. We have bought a couple of +6db yagis
as well for some more directional testing.

I spoke with Alex from the Pi foundation at LCA, and he says that it
is possible to get the current on a Pi down to about 50mA in sleep
mode, so some substantial gains over your initial efforts are
possible.

I need to do a blog-post on our battery solution we are using for
these prototypes, as we have ordered some samples from OptimaBattery
in China (who make lots of EV batteries).  The ones we got are a bit
of an overkill, being 10AH 12v LiFePO4 batteries, but at 120WH, they
can run stuff for quite a while.  These are US$66 in sample quantities
(plus about the same in freight!), but should run a mesh helper
prototype for about a week between recharges.

We are trying to get a flexible solar panel intime for KiwiEx, but it
is proving hard with the short lead-time due to Chinese New Year. The
other option is to get one locally for about 3x price.

Serval would like to create a distributed group of reviewers who would

software is valid (for some measure of validity eg it functions
properly and has no backdoors or built in shutoff code), then the apk
would be offered to install. Hopefully this would prevent a Limewire
style death by court order.

The basic problem as I see it, is that the contents of the apk is not
quite deterministic. I have wondered about forking a tool like
ApkAnalyser, to perform an automated comparison of two compiled apk's
to highlight any important differences. So you can build the
application from source and compare to the version that I built. Then
when you are satisfied you would add a signature to my binary.

Any other suggestions about how we might go about it?

We are hoping to implement Gitian ( http://gitian.org/) soon, which is a
side project by one of our main contributors.

"" Gitian is a secure source-control oriented software distribution
method. This means you can download trusted binaries that are verified
by multiple builders.

Gitian uses a deterministic build process to allow multiple builders to
create identical binaries. This allows multiple parties to sign the
resulting binaries, guaranteeing that the binaries and tool chain were
not tampered with and that the same source was used. It remove the build
and distribution process as a single point of failure.""

1050,Commotion-dev, Throughput advantage to 802.11s support,"Fri, 8 Feb 2013 10:42:04 -0600",-0600,Ben West,"Hi Dan,

First off, I believe all of these patches were made against the current
version of the compat-wireless library.  The first patch did happen to
apply cleanly to compat-wireless-2012-09-07 integrated into Attitude
Adjustment, but the second patch failed.

This first patch is to add short slot time support to 802.11a adhoc mode
(i.e. 5GHz only).  Long slots are required for 802.11b/g adhoc mode (i.e.
2.4GHz) to maintain compliant with the standard.

https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/1835531/

This second patch, on the other hand, will allow short slot slots in
802.11s mode in 2.4GHz and 5.8GHz, which the standard allows.

https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/2050741/

I do understand Sascha, et al, have expressed criticism for the fact that
the 802.11s draft stipulates an arbitrary maximum of 32 nodes per mesh.
(Thanks to whichever dastardly telco lobbyist...)  However, Antonio of the
Robin Mesh project, who has already incorporated 802.11s into this new
Meshroot firmware stack, mentioned how this limitation is actually 50 nodes
as implemented (??), and that it only applies to the number of neighboring
nodes that a particular node can keep in its local table, not that it is a
limitation on the total # of nodes in a mesh.  I'm still seeking
confirmation on this.

Finally, please do note that I have not had the opportunity to test the
operation of these patches yet.  As for the degree of adoption of 802.11s,
besides in the mac80211 / compat-wireless ecosystem of OpenWRT, indeed that
is still a work in progress.

That's partly correct today. Initially the node_id field was 5 bit long -> hence allowed for a maximum of 32 nodes.
I was told cozybit changed that in the mean time (are they then standard conforming?)

What I was told behind the scenes: it was not a telco lobbyist, but actually the companies involved in standardising 802.11s themselves, which did not want it to be much of a success since all of them already had their proprietary protocol implementation :(
I have no idea if this was a mere opinion of this IEEE forum participant or if it really reflected the situation at the IEEE at that time. However, it would explain brain dead ideas like a ""32 bits are enough"".

Do you remember the 802.11s implementation at OLPC? That was terrible...they had to revert to fixed APs.

>  However, Antonio of the Robin Mesh project, who has already incorporated 802.11s into this new Meshroot firmware stack, mentioned how this limitation is actually 50 nodes as implemented (??),

... in any case... is 50 nodes much better than 32 nodes?
Not really. Come one :) 

I'd like to see an 802.11s network with > 1000 nodes!
(Probably will never exist since it is one single collision domain).
To sum it up: I am very doubtful of its scalability. 

For small, local layer 2 meshes it might be OK after it got lots of massaging from cozybit - don't know.
We could test it at the WBM in Denmark.
Try it out and tell us about it :)

When MeshTether is ready to be distributed, I can help with getting it
onto F-droid. Though the process is simple as a I recall:

0: Set up a gitorious account if you don't have one.
1: Clone the F-droid app repo
2: Create and git add file with MeshTether's meta data (you can use
another file in the repo as a guide).
3: Commit and then push to your gitorious account
4: Submit a pull request to F-droid

Let me know if you want a hand with that.

I agree. I find this to be a problem with F-Droid, and one that I am
torn on.

On the one hand, I think that there is immense value in F-Droid's
decision to build all apks themselves. The reasoning that I've read is
basically that they do it to ensure that all the software that F-Droid
distributes is actually free enough that it can be built from
source. 

However what you are doing there is replacing trust in the app
developer with trust in the maintainers of F-Droid. This has been a
problem for other devs, notably Moxie with TextSecure[0][1].

I am sympathetic to both sides of the argument. F-Droid maintains a Free
Software purism that I respect. They use gitorious over github, they
build all software they distribute from source, the don't include any ad
supported software that doesn't allow you to exclude the ads.

In general though, I really want to hold the developers of applications
directly responsible for issues, particularly security issues with
software aimed at activists. I want people living the US (and other
relatively less repressive countries) and claiming something to be
secure to put their real names on the software they're expecting people
to entrust their lives to. That's why I like signed software.

I think the real long term solution is to push F-Droid in the direction
of allowing signed APKs from the developer, and just having their server
side implementation build and verify that the built apks have matching
checksums (or some such similar mechanism); as a short cut to verifying
how free the code is.

Like all of this stuff, it is about who you delegate trust to. For
example, I have not met the majority of Debian developers and
maintainers who sign the software that I run on my machine. However,
I've delegated trust to Debian's system of raising maintainers and
developers, and establishing clear trust chains to people that I do know
and trust. I would say (and just say, since I have no data to back this
up) that the majority of people running Debian, much less its
derivations, don't have any connection or trust path to the people that
signed the software on their system. This is not wholly dissimilar to
the F-Droid situation.

Anyway, assuming things stay the way they are currently, as long as you
stay on top of pull requests for the F-Droid listing, MeshTether (or
other apps) can be kept up to date. But it is definitely an extra step
in the distribution chain. It is also not signed by one of the original
devs in any way which is a bummer.

I'm curious to hear other thoughts on this ? as I'm obviously torn.

Best,

max 32 or max 50 nodes is still the same arbitrarily low limit.

I am curious, tho, which approach would be more effective in getting this
limitation (and its implementations) amended: A) don't use 802.11s at all,
or B) use 802.11s as-is and push for more adoption of 802.11s among your
peers nevertheless, so that the number of people potentially demanding this
amendment increases.

As for meshing across multiple channels (or media, for that matter), I
started a thread<https://lists.olsr.org/pipermail/olsr-users/2013-February/005434.html>on
the olsr-users list asking about good approaches to building efficient
bridges for hybrid mesh topologies.  The
trelay<https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/package/trelay?order=name>package
recently added to OpenWRT looks especially useful for this, and I
think that tool was also mentioned in recent Battlemesh announcements.

I would rephrase your question:
""In which situations does 802.11s or any other layer-2 mesh make sense""?

There are advantages to having a layer 2 mesh: 
 * zeroconf works out of the box
 * your windows shares will appear everywhere (is that good or bad? ;-) 
 * the whole thing is essentially one big LAN -> this reduces complexity

Of course, you have the disadvantage of potentially lower scalability.

Maybe the combination of layer 2 and 3 meshes can become really interesting...

I think we should test it there. trelay came out of a discussion Xavier, Felix, Henning and me at the last WBM in the Bus from the mountains back to Athens.
Felix then hacked the solution in 30 minutes in the bus ;)
It is somewhat a shame that we did not try it yet, it has so much potential.
Especially the combination DLEP + trelay.

The one thing I worry about with a layer 2 mesh, like you describe, is a
lack of control over how far you want certain traffic to go. For
instance, I recently wrote a service advertisement system for Commotion
that uses Avahi/mDNS. Since certain services won't work well over
several hops (like streaming media, perhaps), I'm writing a OLSRd plugin
that sets the OLSR packet's TTL value to be the max number of hops the
service wants to be seen. In other words, an application that only wants
to be seen a maximum of 3 hops away will have its mDNS advertisement
sent in an OLSR packet with TTL=3. That way the service advertisement
won't be seen by any and all nodes that the host node can make a route
to, rather only the ones within a specific radius. (For reference, we
currently use the p2pd plugin to propagate multicast traffic, which has
a hardcoded TTL value of 5, I think).

Would a layer 2 mesh, with everyone on ""one big LAN"", be able to control
traffic propagation in this way?

And having your windows shares available everywhere on the mesh sounds
like a ne'er-do-well's dream ;)

Dan,

Question & feedback:

Were you aware of the previous mDNS plugins for OLSR? (BMF and ninux's mDNS plugin)?
I did not compare your version with theirs yet, but I would be curious what the differences were and why you chose to re-implement it. Was it the reduced TTL ? Was there some problem with the existing mDNS plugins?
Just curious - I don't use mDNS over here at all so I really don't know.

I can see a use-case for this at exhibitions and museums which probably
is a bit out of line for the original purpose of this project, but could
perhaps give some more users and hence testing?

Yeah one of the reasons I didn't use BMF was that it used MPRs, and, if
I'm not mistaken, those aren't used by OLSRd anymore? Plus the code
seemed to be much bigger and more complicated than I could wrap my head
around! But I think your wish for an integration of the existing
multicast plugins is a good idea.

I'm not sure of the procedure for pushing it to the olsrd repo, and plus
I'd like to give it some more testing to make sure I'm reconstructing
mDNS packets correctly. I'll send it out to the olsrd dev list after I'm
done that. Thanks for your work on P2PD!

1073,Commotion-dev, What would you do with the USB port on your,"Mon, 11 Feb 2013 22:16:55 -0600",-0600,Ben West,"Leading on Josh's excellent suggestion for attaching an entropy key to an
access point's spare USB port (whether TP-Link, Buffalo, or some other USB
capable device), what are thoughts about using a *single* such entropy key
within a mesh to improve the entire mesh's encryption strength?

That is, imagine a mesh which begins with no encryption (whether IBSS-RSN
on the adhoc or WPA2 on the virtual APs).  Now, add a single TP-Link box
with the entropy key to the mesh.  Next, systematically use the output of
that key to regenerate the DSA hostkeys of all nodes w/in the mesh
(administered via SSH sessions).  Then turn on IBSS-RSN on the adhoc mesh,
along with WPA2 on all nodes' virtual access points, again using the output
of the entropy key.  Next, have all nodes regenerate their hostkeys *again*,
and the iterate so forth until an appealing degree encryption has been
reached.  At this point, the nodes then could mutually adhere to a regular
schedule of renewing their WPA2 and RSN keys.

Whenever an event occurs where the mesh's security have been deemed
compromised (e.g. an unknown MAC address joins the IBSS-RSN encrypted
mesh), all mesh users could be alerted of this event, the mesh could switch
to 'insecure' mode, and this process of renewing all keys could start from
scratch.

Such a scheme would still have the fundamental weakness that having an
""untrusted"" node within the mesh at t = 0 undermines any subsequent effort
at maintaining security via encryption, and really this limitation is going
to be inherent to the social nature of a community mesh.  However, could an
automated, mesh-wide process of repeatedly renewing nodes' encryption keys
using the output of a single device like the entropy key still yield a
usable degree of encryption?

The geobounding box is exactly what I  wanted for rss, to have an

Yes, so at present we have the capacity to advertise the geobounding
boxes of bundles, which would naturally require a GPS fix to include
in a bundle's manifest.  Similarly nodes would need a recent GPS fix
to decide whether to accept a geofenced bundle.  We do not currently
add the geotags, nor do we check them, but the facility is there,
albiet untested.

Data will tend to distribute from where it is released on the mesh.
If there are more bundles than can be synchronised across the entire
mesh, then it is expected (but not proven) that data will be more
likely to be available nearer where it was produced.

work as desired, although I wonder if the speaker actually had a chance to
test that.  I think some of the ath5k and ath9k chipsets, as their
compat-wireless drivers are implemented, enforce a maximum 1000ms beacon
interval, so *997* will have to be your friend.

I'm also surprised he was successfully running APs at just 4mW transmit
power for roughly room-wide coverage.  He did mention his preference for
high-gain antennas over increased power, implying that low power could have
been in conjunction with large (e.g. ~10db) dipoles.

There is also this PDF from Bastian Bittorf / Freifunk that was published 2
years ago.  Similar advice, including tips specifically gears towards adhoc
mesh operation.
http://wiki.freifunk.net/images/7/73/Vortrag.pdf

Bastian's presentation also encourages adoption of zram for more efficient
memory footprint on RAM-limited devices.  This is now in OpenWRT trunk, and
I'm curious if such might permit operation of minimal Commotion-OpenWRT
(but with the luci-splash package) on 16MB devices, like those hundreds of
FONeras Sascha still has sitting around. ;)

1087,Commotion-dev, first test version of NetworkManager integration,"Thu, 14 Feb 2013 14:21:14 -0500",-0500,Hans-Christoph Steiner,"
Hey all,

I got the core of my 'dispatcher script' NetworkManager integration working,
its called 'nm-dispatcher-olsrd' for now.  It uses the very simple
'dispatcher' script API to launch a python script in respond to network
changes (interface up/down), then that python script talks to NetworkManager
over dbus to get the whole picture. It then parses any profiles that are in
/etc/nm-dispatcher-olsrd and if a new wifi connection matches one of the
profiles, it sets up olsrd properly.

The profiles are the same format as the MethTether profile, and the
nm-dispatcher-olsrd Ubuntu packages I created include a profile for
commotionwireless.net/02:ca:ff:ee:ba:be/channel 5.  So if you are within range
of another commotionwireless.net node, you should just be able to install
nm-dispatcher-olsrd, click commotionwireless.net in the NetworkManager wifi
browser panel applet, then have working OLSR mesh!


To try this on Ubuntu/Mint and probably Debian, do:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:guardianproject/commotion
sudo apt-get install nm-dispatcher-olsrd


Here are the repos:

Its still pretty raw, but if you're up for diving in, I'm happy to have
feedback.  I added a hack to configure the commotionwireless.net connection in
NetworkManager but it doesn't really seem to work, so you might need to
manually configure the adhoc wireless settings in NetworkManager for now,
until I figure out how to automate it.

We've got the kinks sorted out on starting up olsrd reliably on Mac OS X,
turns out that 255.255.255.255 broadcasts work oddly on Mac OS X, so we can't
use them.  They only go out the ""first"" interface, not all interfaces, so if
the ""first"" interface is the wired ethernet, then the broadcast never goes out
to the wifi.  By not setting Ip4Broadcast in olsrd.conf, olsrd choose the
broadcast address that's configured in the interface, so that should work
reasonably well.

Also, the dyn_gw plugin only works with the Linux kernel (and maybe FreeBSD if
you use the linprocfs to provide a Linux compatible /proc).  If that's an
essential part of the commotion mesh, then something will have to change there
to support non-Linux systems.

1094,Commotion-dev, my failed deploy report,"Sat, 16 Feb 2013 20:43:24 -0500",-0500,Sean McIntyre,"Hey list,

I went out yesterday to set up some NanoStation M2's but overall failed
wholly. Wanted to report back on the experience for everybody's benefit.
I'm interested to hear if I did anything wrong so I can adjust my
techniques for next time.

A major usability field ops feature I would love is the NanoStation M2
reset button to do a ""manufacturer reset"" on the firmware. That would have
saved me some headaches. Let me know if it actually does that and I'm doing
it wrong. (Also let me know if I just volunteered to implement this. ;))

Okay, here we go:

Router #1 issue: Could not log in to web interface / unknown password

Version: ""Powered by LuCI Trunk (trunk+svn8676) CommotionWRT Pre-Release
PR3""

It could be a case of forgetfulness, but I became unable access this router
via the web interface. The password prompt always failed, despite trying
every password I know. ;)

So time to reset! But holding the master reset button (powered on) doesn't
seem to have any effect, the configuration doesn't wipe / allow me to set a
new password. I reflashed it.

This one has been left outdoors for the last month.

Luckily I brought a second router with me, so I swapped the device, but...

Router #2 issue: Adding bridge interface between mesh and LAN interfaces
made device inaccessible over LAN interface

Version (same): ""Powered by LuCI Trunk (trunk+svn8676) CommotionWRT
Pre-Release PR3""

This could also be operator error, but here's the scenario:

1. Nanostation M2 (call it ""A"") setup with stock Commotion on my roof
2. Nanostation M2 (call it ""B"") setup with stock Commotion on target roof
3. Station A was connected to my home router with an Internet uplink
4. Station B was successfully connected to Internet from Station A via the
mesh interface, and its LAN port was connected to an Ethernet hub (not
router)
5. My computer (OS X) was connected to the Ethernet hub via Ethernet cable
and could access the LAN interface (192.168.1.x). Set up a default route on
my computer to send upstream packets to Station B, but the default setup
didn't pass packets from my laptop, through the hub, through Station B, to
Station A (and to the Internet)

My next move was to set up a new bridge interface over Station B's LAN
interface and mesh interface in hopes this would pass along the packets.
Saved, waited, and could no longer connect to Station B's LAN interface.

Tried to reset device with reset button and revert back to original config,
but like before, this did not reset the configuration.

Had to give up, came home with the device and saw that the device was
accessible over the WiFi interface and successfully logged in. So that
makes me think that it could be my error, would love to know if so.

Anyways, looking forward to hearing back!

Thanks,

Sean

1099,Commotion-dev," OSX ""Meshbook"" app: UX, Tech, and Status","Tue, 19 Feb 2013 00:02:43 -0800",-0800,Bradley Greenwood,"Hi all,

Things are moving along.  I'd like to give project status and possibly ask for some feedback / guidance / direction on the UI/UX front (being the ui/ux lover that I am).

UI/UX
I've read through the ""Human Interface Guidelines"" docs on the Commotion website and i'd like to tailor the user experience as closely as I can to:

   https://commotionwireless.net/docs/hig/key-processes

Mobile and desktop are (obviously) much different experiences in this realm so its taken me a while to wrap my head around the best course of action on this project.   Heres the breakdown of my current user experience (see attached screenshot):

1) User opens app and is displayed a menu(let) with tabbed window.
2) A list of available adhoc networks is displayed that a user may connect to. (Its my understanding there is no way to tell from a network scan that olsrd is running on a remote adhoc).
3) The user may choose to connect to an existing adhoc: in this case, the network connection is made and the bundled olsrd binary is started.
4) The user may also choose to start his/her own mesh network (adhoc): in this case, the user has the ability to connect through a given/managed profile or he/she can create a new connection ""on the fly"" (by adding settings). *note: this can be seen in screenshot.

Side note: I was able to find a slew of vector images I modified and reused for the app.  The pin-style icons I believe you used in the android app so I tried to stick with the same idea/flow (just placeholders for now). 

Now, please clarify for me (and kindly forgive my ignorance, i'm new)? Its my understanding that a profile is for creating a new mesh (adhoc) network that people can associate to. I'm also under the assumption that the only way for a person to connect to an adhoc network is for me to scan for a list of available (open) IBSS networks. Are the profiles used for both creating and joining a mesh network? Are there cases where an adhoc network wouldnt be detected on a scan (no olsrd)?

If it fits within this scope, i'd like to make the process (experience) of connecting to an adhoc->mesh a little more intuitive by using connection ""walk-thru"" screens for the user. More along the lines of: https://commotionwireless.net/docs/hig/key-processes
   
Please tell me if this would be beneficial (or if that is even in scope).  IMO, the user needs a helpful way/guide of knowing what to do on program launch (connecting to an available adhoc network, knowing what to do when he/she is connected to the mesh, what to do after that, etc)? just thinking through this.  It appears that you've nailed this nicely for mobile but I didn't see any commotion HI guidelines for desktop.

TECH
As for the tech side of things, here's the rundown on how i've implemented.  For the Cocoa geeks that are reading, as you know, there are some big differences in osx versions between 10.5 and 10.8, especially for the apis we're needing to use.  I chose apis (non-private) that we'll be able to refactor if/when we need to support 10.5 or 10.8.  I focused primarily on 10.6+10.7 compatibility.

On application launch, I immediately fire a notification to a sharedInstance (singleton) that does 3 primary things: a) gets a pid, kills a pid (as root), and executes command line with args (as root). I kill off any processes named olsrd and execute the bundled olsrd binary.  I originally had tried sending the kill signal to olsrd but found that it wouldn't always terminate.  kill -9 seems to be the only reliable way to terminate the process but am afraid this might lead to a zombie open port?  I'm also passing the interface en1 as a param to olsrd -- should this be user configurable?  

Also to note, I start olsrd BEFORE connecting adhoc.  I do this because olsrd has some startup overhead in terms of time it takes to load it's json plugin.  Why does that matter?  Because we're executing olsrd as a shell script, there are no callbacks and I cannot inform my data sync poller to begin fetching json from localhost:9090 until olsrd has begun running.  We must wait for olsrd to fully load so we're able to begin polling.  Why are we using a shell script?  In order to run as root, we're severely limited as to how we can auth on 10.4-10.8.  The 3 options are a) sign our app and use SMJobBless() if >= 10.6, b) use applescript (deprecated methods that partially work) or c) use AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges (now deprecated but fully usable).  I chose the lesser of the 3 evils and went with ""AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges"" .  As of 10.7,  unfortunately, the ""right"" (and really only) way to auth as root is to sign the app and use SMJobBless() or equivalent.  We'll need to figure something out if wanting to support 10.8.

Once olsrd is humming, we're able to fire-up our ""MeshDataSync"" delegate.  We use this for polling localhost:9090 using NSTask, NSTimer, NSURLConnection, and operation queues.  This allows us to queue up requests on a different thread (run loop) so we don't block the main thread (8 second intervals).  Yes, we're using multi-threading for this but I may rethink it at a later time.  

Next, we use a great lib (CoreWLAN) for network connection and management.  This allows us to display and manage WiFi/IBSS data from our interface.  If we want to support versions earlier than 10.6, the best way would be to use Apple's 80211b.h (private apis).  They aren't very well documented, but in my opinion, better than using shell scripts.

Josh, can you shoot out a brief overview of what you will gather from 
the current scan function, and possibly an idea of what you see from 
scanning plug-ins in the future?

In-house we have been thinking of profiles as sets of settings for 
various use-cases. This way a setting file might be a backhaul node, a 
gateway, an application server, a tor-gateway, etc. In this way if a 
user has the correct settings for another network, or scans and gets 
enough information, they can use a profile to connect to a network as a 
specific type of node. I am more than willing to go into much more depth 
if you desire. There are use cases where a user is setting up the node 
outside of range of a network and, as such, won't see a network. 
Otherwise a scan should detect all ad-hoc networks. (I am not 100% on 
this with the current version of the daemon, so Josh correct me if I am 
wrong)

Funny you mention this... We are in the first round of testing on the 
""Commotion Quick Start"" for the OpenWRT instance. You can find an 
overview here - > 
https://code.commotionwireless.net/projects/commotion/wiki/QuickStart . 
This has been my rabbit hole for a little over a month, and our field 
team is working on creating the best pathing for new users who want to 
set up a network right now. I will make sure that I put up the notes 
from our sessions so you can see them. Also, shoot me an e-mail and we 
can set up a skype call to go over what we have, give a demo, and can 
get your ideas and what you have done so far. (I know, I know, never go 
off list. I will summarize our conversation and put it on the list after 
the fact.)

will just add a couple of points related to the HIG.

As you work through the interface, please feel free to ask questions or
suggest improvements to the HIG. The existing doc came out with the
first generation of Commotion, and the project has evolved quite a bit
since then. We have always seen it as a living document, so if something
seems confusing or forced, please bring it to the dev list.

We expect to find idiomatic differences as we add new platforms,
applications, and use cases. Our goal is not really to create identical
implementations, but to provide the tools to build a recognizable
Commotion widget that also works within the widget's native framework.

For instance, if the pin-style icons are too big or the borders are too
heavy for your application (as is often the case in mobile apps with
small screens), you can scale them or suggest alternatives. We just ask
that you bring it to the list so we can update the HIG as needed.

You can see some of this evolution in the new OpenWRT theme:

1103,Commotion-dev, olsrd plugin config for GNU/Linux and Mac OS X,"Tue, 19 Feb 2013 11:32:41 -0500",-0500,Hans-Christoph Steiner,"
For the Mac OS X and GNU/Linux clients, I'm wondering how the olsrd.conf
should be configured for the default commotionwireless.net profile.  dyn_gw
only works on the Linux kernel, so that's out on Mac OS X.  arprefresh,
nameservice, and p2pd seem to only be built on GNU/Linux and Android, so I
guess they also only work with the Linux kernel.

For GNU/Linux, there is then the question of how to configure nameservice and
p2pd.  It looks like 'name' should be unique per-host:

LoadPlugin ""olsrd_nameservice.so.0.3""
{
        PlParam ""name"" ""commotion-7814921""
        PlParam ""sighup-pid-file"" ""/var/run/dnsmasq.pid""
        PlParam ""suffix"" "".mesh""
}

And with p2pd, it looks like NonOlsrIf needs to be updated based on the
interface names of the machine that it is currently running on.  Is there a
way to handle that in the olsrd.conf?  Otherwise I guess that the conf file
will have to be rewritten based on the network devices on the installed machine.

LoadPlugin ""olsrd_p2pd.so.0.1.0""
{
        PlParam ""NonOlsrIf"" ""eth0""
        PlParam ""P2pdTtl"" ""5""

exactly be hard-coded. One option could be to patch or customize the
namservice plugin so that it just uses the machine's hostname; that
would be simple to implement.

Can anyone shed some light on what we use p2pd for currently? I started
customizing p2pd for use with service advertisement and discovery, and
if there aren't any other uses for it, I think we should adopt the DNSSD
plugin I put together and drop p2pd. It's highly unlikely that DNSSD
will ever make its way into the official OLSRd code, but I don't see a
reason why we can't include from our own repo.

DNSSD uses the same plugin params as p2pd, but with some added options.
For service advertisement and discovery, we just need to capture any
outgoing mDNS traffic. I know that on Linux & OpenWRT, Avahi-daemon by
default sends outgoing advertisements on all local interfaces...so the
""NonOlsrIf"" option could really be any non-mesh interface name. I'm not
sure how mDNS is implemented on Android, but the same principle applies:
NonOlsrIf should be set to a non-mesh interface used by mDNS.

If there's a way to determine this in a way that could be coded into the
DNSSD plugin, that might be a good way to go. Do you think that would be
possible? Without a way to do that, I suspect the conf file (with p2pd
or DNSSD) will have to be rewritten based on the network configuration
of the device.

The (extended) SmartGateway is far more important. 0.6.6 can set up multiple tunnels, where for new connections the best gateway is pinpointed. Moving nodes keep the selected gateway for existing connections. Does ipip tunnels work on OSX? (hmm, typing on Macbook, few meters from my Linux olsrd gateway _with WiFi AP_, no time to verify...).

We have built the PUD plugin for position update distribution. It distributes dynamic (GPS) positions and ID (type&ID) field in compact messages. DNS names is one of the supported ID types. An extended version could update name server resolve cache.

On p2pd, I use the lo interface for forwarding local host multicast/broadcast packages. Tested on Android only, with BMF. It should work on p2pd and mdns also.

On dynamic config: when I need such, I usually use a start script that copies template to a /var/run (or whatever rw folder) and update it as needed before starting the daemon.

p2pd is for broadcast/multicast packets that have to be flooded, such as MS Groove (hmm, I know). The good thing about Groove: it uses the links to neighbors whenever possible.

When you ran this command, did you replace '/path/to/your/android-ndk-r8' with the actual path to your local installation of the Android NDK?

Do you mean that you did not find the files in the place where the precompiled version installs them?

I'm sorry that I'm not able to read this from the context of your email, but are you attempting to compile olsrd for Android or the Mesh Tether application for Android? The answer to that will definitely help us debug!

Those are the right steps.  Adhoc mode is essential.  Focus entirely on that
first.  Android 4.x devices are proving quite difficult to get into adhoc mode.

If you are familiar with Debian or GNU/Linux in general, I'd recommend
installing Lil' Debian on your tablet, then using 'iwconfig' or 'iw' to work
more directly on getting adhoc mode.  Once you have Debian setup, you can use
Terminal Emulator on the device, or I find it easier to do 'adb shell' then
run /debian/shell, and do it all from a full size screen and keyboard :)

I'm working to get compile, working versions of Commotion DR1 /

May I pepper you with assorted questions to help started quicker?

1. Does Quickstart depend on a specific revision of OpenWRT 12.09, or
is whatever current revision of Attitude Adjustment so far OK?

2. Does Quickstart still have any lingering dependencies on the
commotionbase, luci-commotion, and luci-theme-commotion packages from

We have it working on the Galaxy Nexus, running a custom CM 10 (thus 4.1.2).
Also the kernel has been tweaked to support wireless extensions (and some other tweaks)...
Just installing CM 10.1 won't work is our experience, some people were of the opinion that adhoc would work out of the box with CM, but when you ask if that's based on first hand experience the answer would be a definite no. We tried and it did not work out of the box (CM 10 that is) on the Galaxy Nexus.

So would we, this is on the hardware level and sadly out of our code 
range. OpenWRT has a hard reset into the default OpenWRT, but until you 
have loaded OpenWRT this functionality is not baked into the router.

The OpenWRT initial flash does not have a password. Did you try logging 
in without entering a password? That is the only way to get past that 
interface before you have set a password. You can also set the password 
by logging in over telnet.

To my knowledge, it isn't possible to put a UBNT unit into recovery mode
via the firmware, or at least not via 3rd party firmware.  The best you can
do (besides holding down the reset button manually on power-up), is to use
the larger 1Amp POE adapter that comes with an out-board reset button.
I.e. so that you can put the unit into recovery mode after it has been
mounted at the inconvenient end of a 100m long cable.

is an intentional limitation of OpenWRT, although Attitude Adjustment now
includes the 'trelay' package, which could be used to build virtual bridges.

Besides, I think you're referring not to bridging but adjusting firewall
setting so that new incoming connections from the adhoc mesh can reach
devices on a the Nanostation's local LAN.  Allowing all such connections
could definitely be a security concern, so adding means to selectively
whitelist which LAN clients have this connectivity is ideal.

1127,Commotion-dev, Serval Mesh Helper Device / ISM long-range,"Sat, 23 Feb 2013 11:20:22 -0600",-0600,Ben West,"Hi Paul,

Thank you for your detailed response about the UBNT M900 units, and my
apologies for the delay in posing follow-up comments questions.

I've had off-and-on curiosity about radios like the M900 products, i.e.
mount a Nanostation M2 and Nanostation Loco M900 on the same mast, with the
Loco powered by the M2's secondary POE port and providing backhaul for NLOS
situations.

I am assuming the 915MHz radios have better ability to handle NLOS than
2.4GHz and 5.8GHz radios.  That is, in a environment where you can't mount
radios very high above the ground (10-15m max) and where there is lots of
ground clutter (trees, buildings), would the M900 perform better?  This is
the very benefit being touted for the nascent 700MHz TV White Space radios
here in the US, and so I'm curious if the 915MHz band might also have some
of that same inherent benefit over the GHz ISM bands, although to a lesser
degree.

Nevertheless, casual snooping around forum.ubnt.com suggests that the
maximum real throughput anyone is getting from the M900 radios in P2P
installations (using stock firmware) is only the order of 10Mbit/s.

Finally, addressing your comment below, I'm not sure the M900 units would
have that much higher power consumption compared to their M2 and M5
brethren.  Even 1Watt TX power is almost an order of magnitude less than
the AP's overall power consumption.  Indeed, UBNT claims 6.5W max power for
the Loco M900 compared to 5.5W for the Loco M2/M5.

Talking with one of the radio guys here at KiwiEx:

1. 700MHz, 915MHz, 2.4GHz and 5.8GHz bands will all be primarily LOS.
2. Lower frequencies perform better than high frequencies, but 700MHz
is still too high to get real bending.  You need sub 50MHz or so to
get serious bending.
3. The performance difference between 700MHz & 915MHz will not be
great, for equivalent power.
4. The performance of <1GHz vs >2GHz in the face of ground clutter
will potentially be significant due to the difference in wave length.
5. Power/antennae will always make a difference.

Yes, data rates tend to be much lower, in part due to the licensing regulations.
However, for carefully thought out networks (and this does not
necessarily mean IP networks), then even a low bit rate link can be
useful.  For example, we are pushing data over links with effective
link speeds of about 48kbits.

Our 915MHz radios consume 4W @ 1W TX, but of course the transmit duty
cycle will be <=50%, so 2W is the realistic maximum average
consumption.  A small WiFi router like the WR703N consumes about 0.3W
by our estimates.  With power scaling, we expect average power
consumption <1W, and possibly around 0.4W -- low enough to run from a
mobile-phone sized package for a couple of days or so.

I just posted the initial framework for the embedded daemon and library
I've been writing. It's called commotiond, and you can find it on my github:

https://github.com/jheretic/commotiond

It doesn't do a whole lot right now and I'm rapidly adding to it, but
the idea is that it is an event-driven socket server that manages
configuration profiles and settings for connecting to a wide variety of
different networks, and will replace in the imminent DR1 release the set
of bash libraries and scripts that currently comprise most of
Commotion's automation and configuration functionality on the OpenWRT
platform. Eventually, I hope that it will support a unified and
comprehensive API for managing community wireless mesh networks. What's
in github right now is just the initial socket server, client, and
supporting library themselves, which include a variety of tools for
managing profiles, network sockets, and processes, but the actual
commands bringing it together are still being created. I think it's
pretty cleanly written, but I'll be posting a bunch of Doxygen docs for
it as well over the next day.

Any Android device will run olsrd, the question is really which devices support adhoc mode.  If you want to find an Android device that supports adhoc mode, the safest bet is to use an HTC device that runs Android 2.x.  As far as I have heard, no one has gotten a stock Android 4.x device to do adhoc, but you can get it working on Android 4.x by installing a custom kernel.

As for Lil' Debi, you can use the same command line tools to setup adhoc mode as you would any Debian/Ubuntu/etc. box.  If you are not familiar with those commands (iwconfig, iw, etc), you can learn about them following Ubuntu, Fedora, etc. tutorials and it will apply to Lil' Debi on Android.

However, considering that the known working ath9k driver for TP-Link is

It only handles wifi devices.  The dispatcher script/dbus approach used here
would not really handle the complexity of also meshing over ethernet well.
That should wait until there is actual work on the core of NetworkManager to
support mesh plugins.

The issue that I had on Ubuntu/quantal was really related to the wifi driver
(broadcom binary blob wl.o).  I suspect that basically all issues with adhoc
are going to be related to flaky or bad wifi drivers or hardware.

I forgot to mention: the nm-dispatcher-olsrd script has no awareness of
whether a wifi device is USB, built-in, or whatever.  It just handles wifi as
wifi.  I haven't tested it on setups with multiple wifi devices, but I tried
to make the code work in that situation.

It really depends a lot on what platforms you aim to support.  Qt will feed

Nope, not without custom uci calls. The CBI system does not support 
stacking or procedurally generated uci maps. To compensate for this I 
integrated the appropriate UCI calls into each modules ""parsing"" 
function if it is desired. We have pushed most of this over to the 
daemon in the current version.

Many custom uci calls for modifying the various aspects of the node 
exist further back in the repo. You can look at the set_uci function at 
commit 79c23225c259e1adb296d620d7c2b27b83363c55 ""finalized alpha demo 
version of the Quickstart wizard"" for an example of how I handled that. 
Please forgive the abhorrent case statement structure I cobbled together 
to handle this.

Version 003 will build upon version 001 to allow for mini-quickstarts 
for individual luci pages. This will abandon the case-statement style of 
version one and use a uci modification template much like the cbi 
system, but with a greater ability for customization on the fly. This 
will also allow us to start to build up a cohesive set of functions for 
various uci files. This will be after DR1 is released and tested though.

At this point, they know we are ready, willing, and able.  They just need to
figure out if and how they can use outside devs.

Here's someone who claims success with adhoc on Galaxy Tab 10.1 using a custom
wpa_supplicant:

Here's someone doing it on another 4.x tablet:

I'd be very curious to here whether this works.  If it does, that means we
could support some 4.x devices without modifying them by including our own
wpa_supplicant in MeshTether.

If you want to find an Android device that supports adhoc mode, the safest bet is to use an HTC device that runs Android 2.x.  As far as I have heard, no one has gotten a stock Android 4.x device to do adhoc, but you can get it working on Android 4.x by installing a custom kernel.

Ok, I found an approach that is working on GNOME 3, GNOME 3 Classic, Cinnamon,
and MATE.  Those are the environments I have easy access too.  I'll test on
Unity tomorrow, it should work there too.  It should also work on KDE and

me they'll be built in 45 minutes.

Sorry for lurking, but I've been fiddling with your brand spanking new
commotion-mesh-applet.  Seems the version just published to launchpad a few
hours ago won't load.

Launching the applet manually at the command line produces an error about a
missing module commotion_mesh_support.  The version of the applet
immediately preceding would at least load the indicator icon into the panel.

P.S. Great work!

I just found this email among the really huge heap of email I receive
thanks a lot for the response. Now I will try test and report :)

Moreover I found a way to set up an ad hoc network among Samsung tab2 7.0 model P6210 with cyanogenmod 10.1
So kernel 3.0.15 and Android 4.2.1

The easiest way was to bypass wpa supplicant so I compiled and installed iwconfig.
With iwconfig I could created  an adhoc network in a standard way:

iwconfig wlan0 mode ad-hoc essid matteo 

I tried the same solution with samsung 10.1 p5113 but it was impossible enter in  adhoc mode.
There is a problem with Kernel and/or Broadcom driver.

It is really important to understand which is the chipset for each device. Google/Vendors sometimes blocks the adhoc mode
in Kernel space, so even you change wpa supplicant you cannot enter in adhoc mode.


Cheers

Ok, I just pushed an update to fix the non-loading, its building on launchpad now, so if you already have it installed, then 'apt-get update; apt-get upgrade"" should give you the new version.

Right now the Commotion menu applet is just a display of info, but today I'm going to hook up the control to let you initiate the mesh connection there.  For now, you should be able to click on 'commotionwireless.net' in the standard NetworkManager menu applet, and it should set up the adhoc and start olsrd.

Hey Magnus,

Glad to have more people working on this stuff, it can be painful.

The Nexus One has working adhoc with the stock kernel and OS, so its probably not a good example for getting this stuff working on other devices.  Also, you don't need monitor mode for OLSR, just plain on adhoc IBSS mode.

I think the key is to figure out where adhoc mode is disabled in the HTC One V.  Have you tried running Commotion MeshTether on it?  The debug log from the menu of that app could provide useful info.  The other thing I'd do is try directly messing with the wpa_supplicant from the terminal to see if it returns adhoc/IBSS networks in the scans.

I do this kind of debugging using Lil Debi (in the Play store) so that I have a full Debian shell to work in, either via adb shell or ssh.

Thanks for you testing and feedback!

Looks like NetworkManager is not finding any commotionwireless.net nodes in its wifi scan.  Are there any active nodes called 'commotionwireless.net' nearby?  

Creating the first node will happen via the Commotion Mesh Applet by choosing the profile there.  I'm working on hooking that up today.  As things are now, you'll need to associate with an existing mesh.

I can now confirm the latest commotion-mesh-applet package from your PPA
works on my VMware guest copy of Ubuntu Quantal, with a TP-Link TL-WN821N
USB adapter.  That is, virtual Ubuntu with real 802.11n radio, same as what
I had working with the virtualized copy of Commotion-OpenWRT mentioned
earlier on this list.

The instance of Ubuntu did successfully mesh with a Nanostation Loco M2
running Commotion PR3, although the Ubuntu node would not select the Nano
M2 as its gateway node for reasons that I have not yet diagnosed.  It could
be the Nanostation was not properly configured, due to running an older
version of Commotion.

The tarball containing this VM guest copy of Ubuntu is 1.6GBytes, and I'm
hoping to be able to upload it soon here.
https://code.commotionwireless.net/projects/commotion/files

Would anyone on this list have use for a virtualized copy of Ubuntu with
commotion-mesh-applet, for their own testing?  You would need a USB adapter
known to work, e.g. TP-Link TL-WN821N v3 or TP-Link TL-WN721N.

Yes, 'wifi' is a little terminal executable written in C.  It does the adhoc
work, so its essential.  There are ARM APKs available:

Making builds and testing the client would be one good way to start.  I

Yeah, root is non-negotiable, olsrd needs root to get a socket on port 698 and
change the routing table.  That's the tricky part.  But it could make sense to
have a Commotion iOS client in the Cydia app store, or things like that.

The major pieces of the osx app are in place.  With the new Profile Manager, one can now manage Profile settings through the UI and/or manage settings through the file system.  In addition, I've reverse engineered the Wifi Menu app so now our Profile updates will be immediately reflected in the menu bar and the user is able to make a selection there.  Latest source here:

A few remaining todos. I need to add UI around the app window for Status, Log, and Help.  As you know, we also discovered at the end of this process that there is no way to set bssid or channel on any version of osx (10.5+).  I'm still investigating some options.  For the time being, I'll add functionality to scan for ibss networks that match those of the Profile list.  Iconography to distinguish a node in range will help a user to know which of those nodes are closest.  

Much of my testing has been in 10.7 and 10.8.  I was able to get a Snow Leopard install up last night (10.6) so I'll be able to resolve issues for that version as well.

<MMN-o> Heyho, I was wondering if anyone here has used the olsrd (and 
commotion network manager stuff) in GNU/Linux
<MMN-o> because I'm having trouble syncing with some openwrt commotion 
nodes
<MMN-o> the openwrt side won't list my desktop client in the neighbors 
list (but the desktop client does it, increasing the LQ received count, 
but not the NLQ successful transmission count)
<MMN-o> ...and I have no problem connecting to the openwrt node through 
the adhoc network via its published ip
<MMN-o> Hm, two desktop linux olsrd's  don't seem to speak with each 
other as well


I've made sure the essid and bssid stuff are identical, that I run on 
the same channel etc. My two testing chipsets (one at least is a Ralink 
RT2070 USB dongle) will find and communicate with TCP/IP to the other 
nodes, but I can't seem to get olsrd announcement stuff to go through 
it. (i.e. I receive a bunch of data about other nodes, but I can't seem 
to announce my own presence?)

If it matters, the olsrd on desktop is 
0.6.3-git_-hash_10502a6208c4143be6a4f9288f59de16 (Ubuntu 
ppa:guardianproject/commotion) and I run the Nanostation firmware on my 
Ubiquiti hardware which uses olsrd 
0.6.1-git_f2308e2-hash_9aafa10165e89a5f1a11ddd87fc8d01d

The configs have been tried both with default configuration (when 
running olsrd-adhoc-setup and olsrd manually, I've tried both olsrd.conf 
and the /etc/nm-dispatcher-olsrd/commotionwireless.net.conf) and have 
done a couple of changes here and there.

Any ideas on why my desktop can't announce to the openwrt nodes?


Probably not related I also have some trouble when doing this on my 
desktop machines _without_ network-manager, where my wifi interface 
doesn't get the ""RUNNING"" flag enabled in ifconfig. But that's probably 
secondary.

I haven't tried out the network-manager functionality yet, but olsrd
itself hasn't given me problems as long as I've got ad-hoc mode working
on all the devices. Someone with more olsrd knowledge than myself could
help you debug the tables. I would suggest though trying the same
version of olsrd on the devices and see if that helps. We have a fork of
the latest release of olsrd you could try building and running on the

Another thing I would suggest is doing a packet capture on the devices

themselves properly.

I noticed now that the log (output from olsrd rather than the txtinfo 
plugin) reported ""sendto(v4): Invalid argument"" occasionally.
(and packet capturing shows no packages are sent _from_ my wlan 
interface by olsrd - keeping in mind that routing works and I can do ssh 
etc.)

I'll try compiling a new olsrd on my desktop and play around a bit 
more. Thanks for your input!

If you can disable olsrd and have the nodes route to each other manually

The olsrd_secure plugin is not currently enabled, and when I enabled it 
on my desktop at least it did what it should ;)

[ENC]Rejecting packet from 5.14.192.187
[ENC]Adding signature for packet size 20
sendto(v4): Invalid argument
[ENC]Packet not sane!
[ENC]Rejecting packet from 5.14.192.187
[ENC]Rejecting packet from 5.8.83.72


(but seeing there that the ""Adding signature for packet size 20"" is 
immediately followed by a sendto() error, it is even more obvious that 
I'll look closer at why I can't send IPv4 packets...)

You could try commotion-mesh-applet, its very easy to try if your are Ubuntu,
Mint or Debian.  It automates the whole process.  I have it working on a few
machines, and it won't mess with your olsrd config or network config
otherwise, and you can just remove it if it doesn't work.  It also plays nice
NetworkManager, indeed it requires it.

Here are the Ubuntu packages:
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:guardianproject/commotion
  (fingerprint: F50E ADDD 2234 F563)
sudo apt-get install commotion-mesh-applet

versions of Mac OS X.  We figure this is a good place to start.  How essential

My experience is that Apple poorly supports older versions anyway.
Hence it does not make much sense to support 10.6 and lower.

1195,Commotion-dev, Community Wireless caucus at the Allied Media,"Fri, 08 Mar 2013 10:31:04 -0500",-0500,Andy Gunn,"Hi all - I wanted to start the conversation around bringing people
together at this year's Allied Media Conference. For those folks that
aren't familiar with the conference, its an excellent place to come
together with a lot of other individuals and organizations and discuss
organizing strategies for our projects and movements. If you want to
read more, check out the conference web site:
http://amc.alliedmedia.org/

Put it on your calendars! June 20th to 23rd.

The idea is to come together and discuss building and running Community
Wireless networks. What is working for folks, and what are the
challenges? How do we raise funds, or what is the business model in use
for keeping our networks sustainable?

I'm going to reach out directly to folks I have been in touch with over
the past year or so, but I certainly don't know or have contacts with
all of the community networks in the country (or world!). Please pass
this notice around and invite people to the AMC so we can have a larger
and more productive conversation.

You can read the text of what I proposed below, at the bottom of this
email. Obviously this is just a proposal to the AMC, I'm hoping that it
will be approved so we can have the space at the conference.

Just so you all know, there are a number of other wireless and community
technology sessions being proposed this year at the AMC. Please consider
submitting your own proposal if you would like to share your stories and
strategies around your projects:
http://talk.alliedmedia.org/amc2013/tpsngs

Let me know if y'all have thoughts, questions or concerns about this!

Yes, Commotion MeshTether is the most recent version of the OLSR app for Android.  Olsr Mesh Tether is the old name for that.

For debugging, the next thing I would do is install Lil Debi to get a Debian shell to work with:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.lildebi&hl=en

Then you can 'apt-get install' any software from debian, including 'wireless-tools', which provides iwconfig.  I use all the standard GNU/Linux tools via Lil Debi to setup adhoc mode on the hardware directly.  If that doesn't work, then most likely your devices kernel does not support wireless extensions for setting up adhoc mode.  In that case, you need to install a new kernel to get adhoc support.

The olsrd I tried that didn't work was 0.6.3 (0.6.3-git_-hash_10502a6208c4143be6a4f9288f59de16 from Ubuntu 
ppa:guardianproject/commotion)

The nanostation was initially running olsrd v0.6.1 (Commotion PR2) but was updated to PR3 with v0.6.2 iirc. But that should be entirely unrelated.

The problem seems have been entirely on my Ubuntu 12.10 box and as mentioned was solved with an update to latest version (0.6.5+ at least).

I could try 0.6.4 (and self-compiled 0.6.3) and see if I can find the source of the problem.

another idea for ios app maybe WITHOUT olsr, only for wifi-dhcp-clients 
i was thinking about:
a possibility for visualize the olsr node data. (these are already 
existing at olsr nodes via json -> screenshot http://twitpic.com/bvr02y
the app could provide some lifestatistics about these values, and to 
""jump"" from host to host should be possible. (maybe a favourite list of 
nodes could be useful)

even much more wifi-data (snr to each wifi neighbor for each installed 
wifi-interface) is provided via json, but only with root-login (via web-gui)
so with live-updating all THAT data in a nice gui that app could be a 
very nice tool when sitting at rooftop and installing/moving antennas.

there could also be a possibility for having a favourite meshnetwork out 
of a list of wordwide community networks. so we could have one nice app 
with having local information about many, many different towns and areas 
with mesh communities. that could be done similair to the 
hackerspace-api, which is nice decentralized. of course with some other

Gah. This seems way more advanced than what I can explain with my
knowledge. Nevertheless, I did find what caused my error, the -O2 gcc
optimization switch as patched by Debian package ""hardening fixes"":

1. I tried compiling various olsrd versions. All worked.
2. I tried compiling 0.6.3-5~quantal from 'apt-get source'. It didn't work.
3. I tried compiling the 0.6.3.orig source (same as above, without
debian patches) It worked.
4. None of the patches contained any networking code (except the json
plugin, but disabling it didn't have any effect anyway)
5. I found that removing the -O2 switch on line 227 in Makefile.inc, as
patched by 310-hardening-fixes.patch resolved my invalid argument
sendto(v4) issue:

 %.o: %.c
        @echo ""[CC] $<""
-       $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -c -o $@ $<
+       $(CC) -O2 $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -fPIE -c -o $@ $<


Reverting this (and even leaving the -fPIE there but removing -O2) makes
the resulting binary functional.


So the specific problem was caused by the -O2 parameter to gcc, I guess
making it a compiling/linking issue. I don't know enough about this
myself though, so I'm attaching ('O2-opts') the output of what that
level of optimizations means if anyone is interested (gcc -c -Q -O2
--help=optimizers)

Indeed, as described in previous threads, I've had decent success using
TP-Link TL-WN722N and TL-WN821Nv2 radios with Commotion-OpenWRT and now
also with the commotion-mesh-applet for Ubuntu/Debian, both under VMware.
These radios are based on the ath9k_htc driver, with current generations of
Commotion-OpenWRT specifically incorporating the compat-wireless-2012-09-07
driver library.

My reason for using them was to permit running Commotion as a VMware guest,
but with access to a physical radio via USB.  However, as Dan alludes to,
this also permits *any* platform capable of running the v3 kernel and
ath9k_htc driver to conceivably run Commotion.
https://code.commotionwireless.net/projects/commotion/wiki/Vmware-Player#Configuring-the-Commotion-OpenWRT-Guest-with-USB

My understanding, also, is that the ath9k_htc driver is as open-source as
the ath9k driver, now that its firmware component is open-source.

*RF board takes Arduino-like approach*

LONDON ? Lime Microsystems Ltd., a developer of configurable multi-band
radio transceiver ICs, has launched an open-source RF hardware project that
it says is intended to further innovation in wireless systems. The
non-profit initiative has been launched under the name
Myriad-RF<http://myriadrf.org/>with its own website and includes
pre-made RF boards with editable design
files that developers can freely download and use in their own designs.

...

Right now Myriad-RF is effectively based around Lime's LMS6002D
digital-to-RF transceiver. This chip, used in small cell basestations and
suitable to support all cellular wireless standards, includes integrated
ADCs DACs and low-noise amplifiers and covers the spectrum from 300-MHz to
3.8-GHz. Bushehri said Myriad-RF would be open to other suppliers of RF
transceivers if they could meet the objectives of furthering
software-defined radio and field-programmable RF (FPRF) over a similar
frequency range.

The $300 assembled board (not bad, considering the usual cost of PCB
reference designs), along with the option to fab the board yourself using
their KiCad files, looks pretty neat.  For talking to the outside (digital)
world, the board looks to have an SPI and an 80pin header.

Indeed, this looks like it isn't the only low-cost board targeted at
software-defined radio, based on the LMS6002D.  The one below includes an
FPGA and USB 3.0.

1209,Commotion-dev, Commotion-OpenBTS ready for testing,"Wed, 13 Mar 2013 13:55:02 +1030",+1030,Paul Gardner-Stephen,"Hi Dan, All,

Fantastic work. I look forward to playing with this when I get a spare moment.

Not entirely related, and I can't remember what I have shared already,
but we have done further testing with our Mesh Helper devices.  This
includes links of >3KM, and almost a mile in a rural valley with trees
and general obstructions:

http://servalpaul.blogspot.com.au/2013/02/3km-mesh-link-using-mesh-helper.html
http://servalpaul.blogspot.com.au/2013/03/testing-serval-mesh-helper-prototypes.html

While we need to do more work on the firmware of the radios we are
using to get full ad-hoc style mesh operation, these ranges are _very_
encouraging, especially the 1.27KM in the valley, as this is a real
community with real rural obstacles and inter-dwelling distances.

We also had what looked like an almost-link at 27KM, which is not out
of the question with the link budget of these radios.  We think the
forward error correction let us down on that occasion, but further
testing will be required to know for sure.  We might have to go down
to the beach here, and see how far we can walk along the coast from a
mesh helper placed on a pier.

These ranges were all using omni antennae, so no careful aiming was
required.  This is a big advantage for setup.  In fact, one use-case
of the mesh helpers is to share the GPS location data of each unit, so
that WiFi point-to-point links can be aimed to establish high-bit-rate
links between them, where possible.

I say where possible, because in one test we were able to get link
through about 200m of vegetation with Mesh Helpers with omnis where it
was impossible to get 5GHz Ruckus directional units to establish link.
It took about 2 minutes to find a nice spot with good link strength
with the Mesh Helper, and about 3 hours to eventually give up with the
Ruckus unit.

It would be quite easy to add support for the Mesh Helper radios into
this OS image, as it is just a case of looking at any USB serial ports
that come up, and adding them to serval.conf, after optionally making
sure the radios are appropriately configured for local regulations
(frequency, TX power etc).

This would eventually allow SMS/MeshMS, voicemail and VoMP voice call
traffic between phones on the mesh, as well as provide a means for
pushing config/software updates among nodes distributed over a wide
area.

Together, this utility, along with the ease of setting up the links
over longer distances, including as a way to make it easier to setup
subsequent WiFi long-shots, strikes me as offering a big missing piece
to making the Commotion kit really easy to setup.

While the prototype units are currently ""bucket sized"" the core
electronics is pocket sized (TP-LINK WR703N + small radio,USB stick
and USB2serial adapter), and it would be possible to make pocket sized
units with similar ranges, just with a smaller battery (the current
big battery can last several days, and that is without us optimising
power consumption at all).  This, as well as improving the radio
firmware to offer true ""ad-hoc"" meshing are the two main areas that we
would like to work on to improve the Mesh Helpers.

Of course, this is my view from close-up and creating these things.
So I would be very interested in hearing others perspectives on this,
and whether you feel that it would make a valuable part of Commotion.

1211,Commotion-dev, Commotion DR1 is available for download,"Wed, 13 Mar 2013 19:29:52 -0400",-0400,seamus tuohy,"Commotion's first developer release (DR1) is now available for testing. 
This version replaces our September 2012 pre-release (PR3) and adds 
several new features. Though Commotion developers tested each component 
feature, we will begin extensive pre-release testing of the entire DR1 
suite in the coming weeks. We hope you will join us in testing the new 
components.

Pre-built Commotion packages for Ubiquiti routers and Android devices 
can be found at https://commotionwireless.net/download, with DR1 listed 
under Nightly Builds and PR3 listed as Stable. You can view the 
Commotion source code at 
https://github.com/opentechinstitute/commotion-openwrt . You will find 
links to many of the new packages in the Readme, as well as some quick 
notes on building an image for your own hardware.

The DR1 release brings a complete overhaul to the Commotion system while 
still ensuring compatibility with PR3 release Commotion nodes. 
Forward-facing features include a new theme, easy ""quickstart"" node 
configuration, application announcement and discovery, and a one-click 
troubleshooting tool. Behind the scenes, DR1 contains a core Commotion 
daemon and new cryptographic system.

The quickstart tool provides an easy interface for node configuration. 
The Commotion daemon provides a common mesh network management interface 
through an embedded library, and forms the core of future Commotion 
platform development. Commotion's new application suite uses mDNS to 
announce local applications across the network. Users can find local 
applications using the router?s web-based application portal. Node 
owners can easily manage and customize application portals for better 
community application support. The application portal integrates the 
Serval Project's key management daemon, which provides transparent 
message encryption and authentication. Finally, the debugging helper 
creates custom, downloadable documents for offline debugging by network 
administrators.

Each of these tools still requires thorough testing to ensure they are 
both stable and well documented. If you are an interested user, 
developer, hacker, or are just plain interested, we would love to hear 
your feedback. Following initial internal testing, DR1 will undergo lab 
testing on an eight-node physical test environment. Then we will install 
on the Open Technology Institute?s (OTI) 18-node testbed community 
network. Once the software is deemed stable, we will deploy it on an 
active six-node community wireless network for user testing. We have 
pre-built images for testing on Ubiquiti wireless hardware. The source 
code includes instructions for building Commotion?s test release on 
other hardware for those that wish to test on their own devices.

We will update the documentation to incorporate user feedback once 
testing is completed. After the build has been thoroughly tested and DR1 
has become stable, we will update the warning label on the downloads 
page to reflect the capabilities and limitations of this release. We 
will then bring the other Commotion platforms up to feature parity with 
the DR1 Commotion OpenWRT release.

1215,Commotion-dev, Python-based testing framework across Ubuntu/Debian,"Fri, 15 Mar 2013 13:48:38 -0500",-0500,Ben West,"Hi All,

In lieu of recent progress towards getting Commotion to a working state on
Android, Ubuntu/Debian. and now possibly OSX, what thoughts about building
a simple and (to whatever degree feasible) cross-platform testing framework
in Python?

The general idea is that python scripts could be used to start hitting the
test vectors listed here (note the server appears to be really slow):

https://code.commotionwireless.net/projects/commotion/wiki/Testing#Mesh-Routing-Tech-Evaluations
https://code.commotionwireless.net/projects/commotion/wiki/Testing#Testbed-Requirements-based-on-test-suite-defined-above
https://code.commotionwireless.net/projects/commotion/wiki/Testing#Release-Candidate-Test-Regimen

That is, assuming Ubuntu/Debian/OSX's python support as a starting point,
could these lighweight python implementations allow for some unified test
scripts across platforms?

http://qpython.com/ (for Android)
https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/packages/lang/python/Makefile (for OpenWRT,
to be compiled as module)

Has anyone on the list had good experience with these Python
implementations?

My original thought for such testing scripts was to do them in shell
scripting, but I'm guessing Python would be easier and more powerful.

Python is great for writing tests, and runs in many places.  If the tests themselves are based on TCP/IP and jsoninfo, and written in python, then I think they'll be quite portable, and should run fine on Windows too.

The tricky part is that each platform is going to have different ways of getting things into adhoc mode.  You can do something quite similar with Android and GNU/Linux since they both use the Linux kernel, but honestly, recent versions of NetworkManager are so much better to deal with for setting up adhoc than the low level stuff.  So that means Android and GNU/Linux would be handled differently.

Thanks for the response.  Indeed, each platform would have its own
eccentric way to establish the adhoc connection.  So writing any such test
scripts would have to account for that, even if one wasn't attempting to
share any portions of the test scripts.

My curiosity in leveraging the cross-platform nature of Python (albeit with
platform-specific hooks to radio mgmt) is that such would not be so easy
with tests written in shell scripting.  Likewise, script hooks for those
instances where we can rely on NetworkManager, instead of having the Python
script itself start the adhoc interface.

Since the list of desired tests is pretty exhaustive, I think *any* extent
to which portions of those tests could be implemented across multiple
platforms simultaneously indicates those tests that ever actually get
implemented. ;)

1219,Commotion-dev, Device compatibility for Mesh Tether (and Serval?),"Sun, 17 Mar 2013 15:01:02 -0500",-0500,Ben West,"Hi All,

I've been surfing the listserv archive, and pestering poor Hans, in search
of a handset known to be compatible with the Mesh Tether app, and similarly
with Serval.  I would like to get such handset myself.

However, since Mesh Tether is known NOT to work with AndroidOS 4.x, I have
to locate older, used handsets, adding to the challenge.

Many devices have been reported on this listserv as possibly working.
However, I believe Hans clarified that only these devices are known to work
fully.

   - HTC Desire running android 2.3
   - HTC Wildfire running CyanogenMod 6.1.0
   - In general, HTC devices running 2.x (especially the Incredible)
   - Google Nexus One (stock 2.3.3), and *NOT* any newer Nexi

In contrast, these devices have been reported to work somewhat, but are
expected to be flakey:

   - HTC myTouch 3G (kind of works)
   - Samsung Tabs running Android 3.2
   - Samsung Galaxy S2
   - Samsung Galaxy Player 5.0 running stock 2.3.3 (works only sometimes)
   - Motorola Droid/Milestone running CyanogenMod 7 (mostly works)

Hans mentioned that although Samsung handsets appear work, and have been
tested to a small extent, they are expected to be quite flakey/unreliable.
Likewise, the Samsungs require custom kernels and/or custom kernel options
specified at boot, correct?

Please respond to this thread if you have successfully tested a handset,
and tested it for reasonable duration of time to ensure no flakiness.  Or,
please respond if any of the handset mentioned above is incorrectly listed
as working.

Ideally, the responses to this thread can be used to better populate this

There has been past discussion on this list about how Mesh Tether,
Serval, and SPAN all do ad-hoc differently, and we should figure out
concretely how we want to move forward on this. It would be beneficial
to get everyone's thoughts and expertise on this planning. Perhaps we

which is more about educating users about our current capabilities
without root, I've been very tempted to replace all of our adhoc
control code. Our current process is very convoluted for the things
it's actually doing.

This is roughly the current process that Serval uses to find loadable
wifi modules, which is itself based on the old wifi-tether app. With a
couple of little tweaks we should implement;

Turn wifi client on and off through the SDK, compare the list of
loaded / running modules, look for known wifi module names &
interfaces.

If the wifi module has been compiled into the kernel, there's no point
trying to load it dynamically (eg most google android 4.0+ devices),
so just skip to configuring the interface and see it that works.

Look in the filesystem for a dozen or so known modules, firmware blobs
etc, matching against the above list of loadable modules.

Not one of those? Start scanning the filesystem;
- read libhardware_legacy.so looking for module path and parameters,
check that it matches the detected hardware
- find all .ko files
- read the contents of scripts and config files looking for module parameters

For tiwlan chipsets, find known wlan_loader & firmware paths, copy
tiwlan.ini and make a couple of changes.

For broadcom chipsets, copy nvram.txt and make sure the MAC address is
unique (for huawei ideos), make sure ""dhd_pkt_filter_enable=0"" is in
the module parameters or the mesh will be useless when the screen
turns off.

Try loading each module found above and attempt to configure the interface.

If setting adhoc mode fails, you'll probably need a custom kernel.

If at any time we receive a broadcast Intent indicating that wifi
client or hotspot failed to start; bring the interface down, unload
the wifi module and start the operation again.

I also added a blurb that the Motorola Atrix 2 probably would *not* work,
since it is (naturally) a completely different chipset than the Atrix 4G.

I think the best step is to start combining the strengths of each into
a single dedicated ad-hoc on android application.  That application
may well be one of the above, rather than creating yet another new
thing.
My feeling is that SPAN may well be the logical application to extend
in this way, and then we all just add hooks in our applications to
make use of the services that SPAN provides.

1226,Commotion-dev, Can't talk between desktop OLSRd and Commotion,"Mon, 18 Mar 2013 14:38:53 -0500",-0500,Ben West,"Hi All,

I'm having difficulty replicating this solution on my own platform (Ubuntu
quantal i386 under a VMware host, but with real USB wifi radio).

That is, removing the O2 compile option and recompiling olsrd does not seem
to yield a working olsrd for me.  I'm presently trying this out on a real
host instead (i.e. no virtualization), but that is slowly opening a
delightful can of worms w/r/t/ to thge newer Ubuntus dropping legacy video
driver support and other such pleasantness.

If the problem's source has been conclusively narrowed down to the -O2 (and
even -fPIE?) flag added by Hans' patch 310-hardening-fixes.patch, could
Hans just release an updated olsrd package in his PPA, with those flags
removed, as an interim workaround for anyone not able to compile their own?

This patch was referred to in the thread started by Hans on this topic in
the olsr-dev listserv:
https://lists.olsr.org/pipermail/olsr-dev/2013-March/006725.html

Interestingly, the original bug was basically that olsrd was not sending
outgoing packets out the wireless interface, instead failing with error
message ""sendto(v4): Invalid argument.""  The variables that are supposed to
store the destination address for IPv4/6 packets, due to improper
declaration, were being sometimes optimized away, depending on the gcc
version and the optimization flags given.  The patch mentioned above
corrects the variables' declaration.

It seems this particular bug has been fixed in newer versions of olsrd, but
I'm guessing Canonical isn't going to be especially prompt about releasing
an updated Ubuntu package.

Could this patch be included in the guardianproject PPA for olsrd?

Sounds like quite an elaborate process.  Is there code anywhere else that handles this level of device probing?  My guess is that SPAN has a framework that handles some of it, but I think serval is doing a lot more of this kind of probing and auto-configuring than any other app.

We are not aware of any of the other applications performing this kind
of auto-probing and auto-generation of control scripts.  That said, as
devices move to 4.1+ the value probably reduces.  But I think it will
be a while before we can ignore <4.1 devices.

you want to help expand access to affordable Internet? Are you an
advocate for open technology, ICT4D or community-owned infrastructure?

If so, then we invite to you to participate in this year's International
Summit for Community Wireless Networks (IS4CWN)
<http://2013.wirelesssummit.org/>. The Summit will take place in
Berlin on October 2-4, 2013.

IS4CWN is a gathering of technology experts, policy analysts,
on-the-ground specialists, and researchers working on state-of-the-art
community broadband projects across the globe. Above all, IS4CWN is a
community of communities, and the annual summit serves as an opportunity
to share ideas and challenges, discuss policy issues, and coordinate
research and development efforts.

The 2013 Summit theme is community. In the past decade -- which included
the founding of Freifunk <http://start.freifunk.net/>, the birth of the
International Summit for Community Wireless Networks, and the genesis of
major projects including Commotion <https://commotionwireless.net/> and
CONFINE <http://confine-project.eu/> -- the community wireless movement
has expanded substantially in both size and visibility.

But where do we go from here? How can we take the movement to the next
level in terms of technological advancement, community engagement, and
diversity? We encourage our speakers, workshop leaders, and participants
to think big this year and help us grow our community of communities.

Interested? Head on over to www.WirelessSummit.org
<http://www.wirelesssummit.org/>.
Registration is open and forms to submit workshop proposals and
request travel funding are available. Early registrants will receive a
50% discount.

Potential topics include: using wireless for social justice, rural
broadband frameworks, technical developments in mesh networking,
spectrum policy, training communities in technical skills, case studies
of networks, challenges of corporate monopolies, and much more.

This year's Summit is committed to having a diversity of voices and
experience, and we're looking to have a lot of new faces in the room.
Community networks encompass a whole range of social, political and
technical challenges, so technical knowledge is definitely not required.

Access to technology and technical knowledge has been historically
inequitable and remains so to this day. Recognizing this, the
International Summit for Community Wireless Networks aspires to include
participants and speakers from a broad range of backgrounds and
experiences. We seek and welcome diversity in order to reflect the
communities that wireless networks can and should serve, cultivating
expertise, creativity, and innovation. Please join us in creating an
environment of respect, equity, and accessibility at all levels of
Summit involvement.

I pushed an update to the olsrd package to our Commotion PPA, they should be
built in about 5 hours.  The only change was including the commit that should
fix this issue.

If the OTI crew thinks that we should be using a newer version of olsrd, I can
update the package there.  Right now, I'm just keeping it in sync with the
effort to get an update into Debian/wheezy.

For our DR1 release of Commotion-OpenWRT, we're using a custom version

Yes, I added some of the Debian hardening stuff to that package.  Some of that
hardening stuff was included upstream and is therefore in v0.6.5.2 already,
but not all was included yet.

I don't know those plugins, so I don't know if they'd be useful.  At this
point, I think the guardianproject/commotion PPA should be focused on
providing a ""stable"" build so that when people try it, they are most likely to
get some kind of working mesh.  As far as I have heard, this client is focused
on end users rather than backhaul providers, so I haven't looked at the
backhaul stuff at all.

How about starting an official OTI PPA and uploading the DR1 olsrd v0.6.5.2
there?  Ultimately, I think it'll be good to have these packages in an
""official"" OTI PPA anyway.  I can set that up if you want, I've set up a few
PPAs on launchpad.

One of our newer members is really interested in taking that on. I had
meant to ping you about it (among other things) but got bogged down in
meetings.

While I do want to keep our stable and experimental packages separate,
we will need to begin porting the new DR1 features (including the OLSR
plugins) over to the non-router platforms.

For what it's worth, here is the target feature list for DR1
(https://code.commotionwireless.net/versions/2), and the beginnings of
the architecture document for the new features as they relate to OpenWRT
(https://code.commotionwireless.net/projects/commotion/wiki/Commotion_Architecture).
Now that the dust has begun to settle from the initial rollout, we will
begin incorporating our notes into the main documentation.

As for using and maintaining a fork of OLSRd, we would ultimately prefer
to incorporate any fixes and plugins upstream instead of maintaining a
fork. Until the outstanding questions around incorporation are
addressed, it seems reasonable to point to our fork. That doesn't
address OLSR's inclusion in debian, but I can't see a near-future
situation in which Commotion won't need to point to a newer version of
OLSRd than debian provides. Am I wrong in thinking these are almost
separate issues?

I did see some bad things happened in the past, where improvements on olsrd were not published upstream and were lost. Some of it: link metrics and fix for MPR flooding. So I strongly recommend new work on olsrd is kept on its home base.

On that note, commotion and olsr devs, where do we currently diverge,
and what are the barriers to integration?

I'm aware of the following:
New olsrd plugins used in commotion DR1 (MDP, DNSSD): OLSR community had
concerns about plugin duplication. Commotion community willing to merge
in order to integrate upstream. Dan, is time the main obstacle here or
do we need more input on how best to proceed?

New bugfix referenced below: Has this been incorporated in the Commotion
fork or only in Guardian's PPA? Have the patches been submitted to OLSR?

Hardening patches: It sounds like this is in process.

It also sounds like we now have two forks (the one we use in
Commotion-OpenWRT DR1 and the one Hans is using on his PPA). If we
haven't already, can we either standardize across our repos while we
work on upstream integration or push the development features to our
fork so Hans can focus on debian inclusion with the PPA? I'm not sure
which would be more beneficial.

That's not something I'm interested in doing, and would be a significant
effort for anyone not already versed in the existing plugins. So I doubt
DNSSD will ever make it into upstream olsrd. Will said there was also a
lack of interest in the MDP plugin he wrote, so that will also not
likely make it upstream. However, we need those plugins for any
Commotion nodes that want to be compatible with DR1.

If the point of the Guardian PPA is to get a hardened olsrd version into
Debian, then I don't think it would be appropriate to include our
plugins in it, since they are not ""official"" olsrd plugins. But if the
goal is to have a Commotion-compatible PPA of olsrd, then it would make
sense to include our plugins.

In terms of my work on olsrd, the only things that are not entirely included
upstream in olsr.org are some of the hardening support, and that is in the
Debian packaging.  The changes are so small, I would not consider them a fork.
 Once we get some more testing done, I'll push these changes upstream as much
as possible.  Some of them only really make sense as part of the Debian packaging.

The bugfix in this thread is included in upstream v0.6.4, so its already
included in the commotion fork, since that's based on v0.6.5.2.

What olsrd needs is someone with the resources to merge the various parallel
efforts of mDNS/DNSSD.  It would be a chunk of work, like Dan said, but it
will benefit everyone if those efforts are merged because maintenance, new
features, bug fixes, testing, etc. would all be shared.  I think it would be
very worthwhile for OTI to take it on since it is the best way to guarantee
the long term maintenance of that code.

Naaahh :)

s/the olsrd devs can be grumpy/all prima donna coders can be grumpy from time to time, even Linus/g ;-)

Don't worry,

1252,Commotion-dev, Python-based testing framework across,"Tue, 2 Apr 2013 03:20:18 -0500",-0500,Ben West,"Hi All,

I've created a repo of a few basic tests implemented as unittests in Python
2.6+.  This repo contains just the Python scripts themselves, so that it
may be included later as a submodule into other repos containing
platform-specific packaging stuff.
https://github.com/westbywest/commotion-tests-core

Due please note I expect this repo to change, and even its location to
maybe switch to OTI's github account at some point soon.

To serve as hopefully demonstrative examples of the test coverage possible,
the scripts I just checked in test for the following:

   - ping localhost
   - ping gateway IP (either default gateway or the one assigned by OLSRd
   smartgateway)
   - ping Google DNS (aka do we have Internet?)
   - presence of an active olsrd process
   - olsrd responds to jsoninfo requests
   - link quality of the next hop is above a specified threshold

These scripts should run under the following Python versions / platforms:

   - Python v2.7+ under Debian/Ubuntu
   - Python for Android (Py4A) app r5+ / Scripting Layer for Android (SL4A)
   app r6+
   - Python-mini v2.7+ under OpenWRT 12.09+

... to test the following Commotion implementations, respectively (where
each is enabled by the user, not by the Python script):

   - commotion-mesh-applet
   - Mesh Tether app
   - Commotion-OpenWRT DR1, with *python*, *python-json*, and *
   olsrd-mod-jsoninfo* modules installed

Questions about how to proceed:

   - Whether to proceed with Python-based testing framework?  I tried to
   heavily leverage the cross-platform compatibility, but is it worthwhile?
   - The Python for Android implementation chosen, Py4A, is only Python
   v2.6.  Is having Python v2.7 on Android worth possibly compiling it into a
   custom APK?
   - Many of the desired test vectors, e.g. throughput testing, require the
   test run simultaneously on at least 2 nodes.  It's pretty easy to write a
   crude server in Python to function as one half of a throughput test, but
   does the complexity of running different Python scripts on different nodes
   simultaneously become unreasonable?
   - The python-mini module for OpenWRT chews up 1.5Mbytes of flash, and it
   doesn't include unittest by default.  This unfortunately appears to be *too
   much already*; it wouldn't fit on a Nanostation flash w/o removing lots
   of stuff.  Maybe this size could be trimmed down by modifying the
   python-mini package's Makefile, or by distributing test scripts in bytecode
   form to OpenWRT nodes.

Not at all, I think that it is necessary to have different nodes running 
tests simultaneously. In most of the openWRT testing situations we run 
currently, we have client devices running simultaneously to elucidate 
information about the mesh nodes.

I think that loading python on to openWRT nodes is impractical. Having 
client devices running tests over the mesh with possible on-node 
analytics running for later collection will give us a good idea of QOS 
without having to load down the OpenWRT nodes, and as such, change their 
performance. We will not get the same level of detail as the android or 
desktop nodes, but it is really the best we can do while maintaining an 
accurate image of the nodes performance.

One idea that's been floated has been having a test suite running on a
device that you could plug into the wired LAN port of a OpenWRT router,
and have the device (maybe a program running on a laptop, or a Raspberry
Pi) run tests. You could have two running at different points of the
network, and they could talk to each other. That way you wouldn't have
to have the test scripts (and the Python interpreter) running on the
routers themselves. Would that be feasible and just as useful?

Any idea what the size of the scripts are when compiled into bytecode?

1255,Commotion-dev, Python-based testing framework across,"Tue, 2 Apr 2013 09:31:38 -0500",-0500,Ben West,"Hi Seamus and Dan,

Replying about having Python on (and off) OpenWRT:

The cross-platform nature seems like it would be very helpful to maintain a
single collection of tests vectors to apply as Commotion finds its way onto
more platforms (Windows, OSX).  But, the obvious tradeoff here is the size
of the Python interpreter.

Also, the test scripts that query a node's OLSR instance via jsoninfo could
also run *on the client*, rather than directly on the node.  The node would
just need to open up the jsoninfo port 9090 on its firewall behind the
public AP interface (or have the client use its private AP).  I can tweak
the Python scripts (tho very little needed) to accommodate this option.

Besides that, I think I may be able to tweak the Python Makefile provided
with OpenWRT, so that the compiled package is much smaller than its current
1.5MByte footprint.  The Python v2.6 implementation bundled into Py4A
(which runs all these tests fine) is *only 150kB*, by comparison.  Still,
admitted that installing another language on what is already disk- and
RAM-bound devices is less than ideal.

Finally, sorry for using the term 'bytecode.'  That's not really what we
need; compiled Python bytecode is neither smaller than source nor
stand-alone executable.  What I meant is maybe compile the Python testsuite
into a single standalone executable using a tool like these:
http://cx-freeze.sourceforge.net/
http://www.pyinstaller.org/

I think that is a great idea for the openWRT instances. Though, as we 
get the other platforms up and running it will be less and less needed, 
since we will be running more powerful devices as nodes.

I don't know what the consensus is, but as much as I would love to start 
to play with python on the OpenWRT nodes, I think we will be able to use 
the existing testing code you built, along with some client based tweaks 
to accurately test a OpenWRT based mesh.

OLSRd will only report details like link quality and routing topology.  For
lower-level hardware information about the wireless interface, e.g. dBm of
remote APs, TX retries, I would highly recommend Henning's fabulous LDEP
implementation that is now in the CONFINE repo.  That is, the python test
script on the client's machine could query data both from the node's OLSRd
instance via jsoninfo, and also from its LDEP daemon.  And Henning would be
thrilled. :)

LDEP implementation targeted at nl80211 for OpenWRT:

I've so far trimmed the OpenWRT python-mini package down to ~1.2MB, now
including unittest.  1.0MByte may be doable with more strenuous weight
loss.  This package could still be handy to have on hand for reference
(i.e. as optional add-on module for Commotion).  I will soon share a repo
with the modified Makefile

If it turns out that python is Just Too Big to fit on an OpenWRT
router, and shell-script ends up being the most feasible, we have a
shell-based test framework that we use to drive testing on the Serval

them.  Let me know if you want more info.

1259,Commotion-dev, Disabling adhoc encryption on current nightly,"Wed, 3 Apr 2013 13:49:11 -0500",-0500,Ben West,"Hi All,

I'm having good success exercising recent nightly builds of
Commotion-OpenWRT DR1 on a Nanostation Loco M2.  I understand this is a new
release, and that it has an active issue queue (which I'm going to post to
soon).  I'm putting this question on the listserv right now, in case this
happens to touch on issues already filed, and also for reference of other
list members.

The Quickstart tool on the new DR1 release is really neat!  At present, I'm
trying out the tool by flashing a node and then connecting to
http://192.168.1.20/ on the node's eth0 port.

However, it looks like QS enables psk2 encryption on the node's adhoc
interface, and I have yet to figure out how to disable it.  That is, the
luci UI lists ""Encryption: none"" for the adhoc, and re-applying /
committing that setting via luci just seems to hang.  Likewise, manually
editing /etc/config/wireless at the command line to disable encryption is
ineffective, because I think commotiond just regenerates that file when I
issue ""wifi restart"", clobbering my edits.

Is there a trick to getting commotiond to not encrypt the adhoc interface?
I need the mesh unencrypted, so that the Nanostation can mesh with my
Ubuntu/commotion-mesh-applet and Android/Mesh Tether devices.

(Also, it seems that I can hack commotiond to not deploy encryption by
editing /lib/netifd/proto/commotion.sh, but I'm asking here on the list in
case there is a more elegant way.)

Thanks.

If you go through the manual configuration and click the ""Continue with 
a insecure network"" button on the Keyfiles and Security page QS will 
remove the servald and wpakey values from the 
/etc/commotion/profiles.d/quickstartMesh profile which is used to 
generate the profiles at the end of QS. Otherwise, it will keep the 
default values, which are pulled from the 
/etc/commotion/profiles.d/defaultMesh config file. When JK gets in the 
office I will ask how commotiond intereperets the profile. From what you 
are saying I am assuming that a blank line results in the default 
behaviour of true. I will post again when I get the correct value to 
disable encryption for the config file.

restart commotion and restart networking. After going through the
quickstart, the adhoc/mesh interface uses the quickstartMesh commotion

If doing the above doesn't fix it, or it complains about your encryption

/etc/config/wireless, and then restart networking. But this shouldn't be
necessary, since /etc/config/wireless is largely generated by commotiond

could have nodes pushing their link-state data to nearby hubs, and then

present a visualization of the full data set. The hub node could be 
running a much more in-depth visualization, perhaps using something like 
Freifunk's map.

Also, OpenWRT by default doesn't support CPU task scheduling, a la the

the same CPU priotity as wpa_supplicant, dnsmasq, etc.  But, if you want
to, it is config option BUSYBOX_CONFIG_RENICE.

Besides that, I've been curious about how useful the 'muninlite' package
could be for this sort of use case.  It implements the munin protocol for
collecting/sending monitoring data just in shell script, meaning the
on-board copy of busybox can execute it.  And I'm assuming it to be
extensible roughly in the same way one can write custom munin plugins.  The
downside, tho, is that muninlite does require the xinetd package.

discussion :)

Hi Zach,

Currently, Raspberry Pi + Commotion is uncharted territory. What I did 
at the National Conference on Media Reform (NCMR) was simply use some 
RPis with wifi cards, put them in ad-hoc wireless mode, and then run 
OLSR to allow them to mesh multi-hop. I also had them running from 
battery packs I got from Radio Shack :)

Using the same wireless settings as the Commotion nodes (SSID, BSSID, 
channel, encryption), they were able to mesh with the Commotion network. 
However, they lacked the rest of the Commotion features. It is on our 
roadmap for the near future to add the rest of the features, and release 
a custom Commotion Raspbian image that you can put on an SD card and 
boot your RPi from.

As for wifi cards, I recommend any USB cards that use the ath9k_htc 
driver. My top choices for cards are:

1. TP-Link TL-WN821N (300 Mbps, MIMO)
2. TP-Link TL-WN822N (300 Mbps, high gain dual 3 dBi antennas)
3. TP-Link TL-WN722N (150 Mbps, with 4 dBi detachable antenna)
4. Ubiquiti WifiStation EXT (super powerful with 6 dBi detachable 
antenna, but much larger than the others)

I have only tested #1 with the RPi. I am worried about #4 working with 
the RPi, in terms of its power consumption. But in general, the 
ath9k_htc devices have great linux compatibility, and Ben West has done 
some great work getting them to do multiple virtual interfaces under 
OpenWRT. I hope to get this working under Debian as well.

The biggest challenge I foresee, besides running multiple virtual 
interfaces on a USB wifi card, is power. The RPi doesn't like to give 
more than 500 mA to USB peripherals, and wifi cards love to gobble up 
power! So stability can be an issue if the wifi card is drawing too much 
current...the RPi can start to act flaky or crash. I noticed stability 
issues at NCMR, but didn't have time to look into it.

Hope this is helpful...

I've done this in VMware-based Ubuntu nodes just by installing the package *
linux-backports-modules-cw-3.**6-quantal-generic*.  For Debian, it looks
like the relevant package from backports is *firmware-atheros*.  You would
probably need to compile that package for relevant kernel version and rPI
target within your toolchain.

As for USB, besides using a separate hub, I think one could readily hack
into the 5V / GND wires on the cable between the rPI and the wifi dongle to
insert a separate 5V supply capable of supplying up to 1A.  Just be mindful
not to tear open the shield around the diff pairs in the USB cable (or not
too badly).  Enclosing all such hackery in shrink-wrap could even make it
look presentable. ;)

Funny you should mention this.  We were just yesterday talking about
HTTP-based APIs to get to contents of Rhizome bundles.  This would map very
naturally to a RESTful-type interface.

So in short, yes, we do intend to expand the Rhizome API as and when we are
able.  A simplistic implementation of an API that will allow access to
HTTP-transported documents from in a bundle is likely to show up in the
coming weeks, but I will let Jeremy confirm or deny my understanding of
this ;)

When I was previously setting the wireless interfaces to use channel 9
instead of channel 5, the freifunk watchdog would routinely bring down
the wireless interfaces. And I have no idea why. The only way I got it
to work was uninstalling ff-watchdog. So see if that may be a reason why
wireless interfaces are unavailable...there should be a note about it in
logread.

I've also noticed that something is killing olsrd on DR1 nodes, without
any clue in the log. The routing table will still have stale routes in
it, indicating that olsrd isn't exiting cleanly. I wonder if it's being
killed by the out-of-memory watchdog. When I was troubleshooting this
before, I wrote a quick script that ran as a cronjob every minute, and
it would pgrep olsrd. If olsrd was running, it would redirect the output
of top into ~/top.out. If olsrd wasn't running, it would move the last
~/top.out as well as logread into a separate directory. That way,
whenever olsrd was killed, there would be a record of top the minute
before it crashed, as well as the log. Would this be useful for
troubleshooting the LTS nodes?

I just checked config on a node again (running Attitude Adjustment circa
r35xxx), and I found these lines in /etc/crontabs/root which had been
commented out:

#* * * * *      /usr/sbin/ff_olsr_test_gw.sh
#*/5 * * * *    /usr/sbin/ff_olsr_watchdog

So, be on the lookout for ff packages that deploy these scripts, although
unfortunately it's not clear *which* package includes these particular
files.  Maybe freifunk-common?

1287,Commotion-dev, Python-based testing framework across,"Wed, 24 Apr 2013 17:17:21 -0400",-0400,Hans of Guardian,"
Sorry to be late in weighing in this thread.  I'm on the train to DC and diving back into a Commotion state of mind.

I like having python test framework a lot, even if it doesn't run on all OpenWRT devices.  To cover OpenWRT, you could set up OpenWRT on any device that has a lot of disk space, then run all the python stuff there.  That would then give you a place to run the full test suite on OpenWRT.  Then on the Ubuquiti hardware could be handled via some of the other ideas here, like shell scripts, or remote scraping via JSON, etc.

Using python is just so vastly more productive that this approach will definitely be less work even though there would have to be some special cases for certain OpenWRT devices

This reminds me, would this also then run in the VMs that you have been setting up?  I think having some random box somewhere running like 20 or more various VMs with olsrd on them could be very nice as an automated testbed.  This would not test the real world wireless conditions, but it would provide a way to run automated tests on olsrd meshes in a way that could be plugged into Jenkins builds.  This kind of testbed would have caught the commit that broke meshing on ARM and amd64 that showed up in the more aggressive optimization of Ubuntu/quantal's compiler.

1288,Commotion-dev, Android stick-PCs as a potential,"Thu, 25 Apr 2013 06:58:11 +0930",+0930,Paul Gardner-Stephen,"Hi all,

Sorry if you have already thought about and discussed these devices, but
they strike me as potentially very interesting for both communities, in
addition to our own interest in them for the Serval Project.

We have been looking at some of the cheap Android-based stick PCs as a
possible platform for Serval Mesh Extenders, such as the MK802ii and more
recent MK808B.  For more about the Mesh Extenders and their long-range UHF
packet radios, refer to:

http://developer.servalproject.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=content:meshhelper:main_page&#prototyping


or:

http://servalpaul.blogspot.com/2013/02/building-serval-mesh-helper-device.html

and subsequent posts to that blog.

The newer generations of the Android stick-PCs have dual-core 1.5GHz ARM
processors, 1GB of RAM and 16GB of flash, dual-antenna 802.11n Wi-Fi
(although the firmware is not ideal, more on that later), USB host port,
microSD slot, and HDMI out, all in a tiny thing about 80mm x 35mm x 15mm
depending on the particular variant you get.  You get all that for under
US$50, e.g., from geekbuying.com.

These typically come with a root-enabled ROM, and are very easy to flash
with a complete new operating system.

Thus compared with many wireless routers they have much greater CPU and
memory resources, and similar or lower cost.

What I wanted to discover what their power consumption was, because I want
to run them off battery for really resilient deployments.

While I was initially concerned about the power consumption, I discovered
that the later generation models can perform useful services, including
running Wi-Fi for about 1W:

http://servalpaul.blogspot.com/2013/04/comparing-energy-consumption-of.html

The main issues that I have identified are likely to be:

1. The Wi-Fi antenna are little patch antenna, which probably don't have
that great performance.  They could be replaced fairly easily though, I
suspect.  On the up-side, they do have two antenna for doing clever 802.11n
things.

2. The Wi-Fi firmware that comes with the ROMs I have found don't include
simultaneous AP and ad-hoc capability, at least as far as I can tell.  This
would need investigation.  They apparently use a Broadcom 8330 based Wi-Fi
chipset in at least some variants, which leads to my next point.

3. The Wi-Fi chipset and design quality varies between suppliers of these,
as it appears that they are all using a reference design of the RK3066
chipset, to which they add Wi-Fi.  Some use realtek or mediatek chipsets
instead of broadcom.  Some implementations are better than others, e.g.,
some sub-optimal implementations seem to have a common ground-plane between
the Wi-Fi and USB, which reduces the sensitivity of the Wi-Fi receiver. All
this is both a negative and positive. On the negative side, some variants
might be complete duds for our desired use-cases.  On the positive side, it
might be possible to encourage one of these manufacturers to make one with,
for example, an Atheros Wi-Fi chipset that is well supported by Linux,
OpenWRT and Debian.  Related, I have yet to survey the complete OS image to
see if there are any other closed binary blobs hiding around the place.

4. There is no on-board ethernet port on the cheaper models.  This could be
solved with a USB ethernet adapter, or again, encouraging one of the
manufacturers to make a variant that is better optimised for our
communities needs.

If anyone in the community is interested in working on porting OpenWRT
and/or enabling simultaneous AP+ad-hoc Wi-Fi on these, we can probably
arrange to provide a couple of MK808Bs to facilitate this.

Paul.

Part of what makes python so productive is the vast amount of libraries available.  If you can find Lua libs for everything, then that would be a starting place.  From my personal perspective, I've never done any Lua, so I'd be unlikely to contribute much to Lua-based frameworks.

US$35, and has ethernet, 2 usb, 512MB RAM, 700 MHz single core
processor, and draws b/w 500-1000 mA @ 5 V (= 2.5-5 W if my physics
degree serves me well ;) ). Attach to that a dual-antenna Atheros-based
USB wifi adapter (e.g.
http://www.tp-link.com/en/products/details/?model=TL-WN822N), which can
potentially do multiple virtual interfaces, one in ad-hoc and the other
in AP mode, and you got yourself a pretty capable gadget.

And at a recent conference, I powered some wifi-enabled, meshing RPis
with simple battery packs. I've even powered them from 2 D cells with a
proper voltage converter, which could potentially power a device for
more than a day.

Just another idea to throw into the mix...  I think experimenting with
the android sticks is a great idea.

1293,Commotion-dev, Android stick-PCs as a potential,"Wed, 24 Apr 2013 18:05:00 -0400",-0400,Hans of Guardian,"
I just got a UG802 device along these lines, I'm going to try it out in DC tomorrow perhaps.  There are a whole bunch of these coming out, they all seem to be based on the Rockchip RK3066, so it seems like a good platform to target.  They can sometimes be bought in bulk for as cheap as US$20 per unit, which is also very nice.

Could you get adhoc mode working on it?  If so, it would make a very nice burner mesh server.  Just install Lil' Debi and Commotion MeshTether from the Play store, and its a server that can be stashed anywhere there is power and wifi/mesh.

The have much faster CPUs that are also dual core.  They include 4GB storage and have a micro-sd slot and USB.  They are also ready to go with Android and the Play Store installed.  I think they are probably a better deal than the RPi for working with wifi.  Attach an external USB wifi, and you have a two radio device.

But this is all contingent on having decent adhoc support in the radio, of course.

I've observed a definite issue with nodes not reliably 'authorizing'
themselves when joining an IBSS-RSN adhoc network, at least since r33202 or
so.  No idea on a cause, besides IBSS-RSN simply being buggy.

Besides doing something crude like putting 'sleep 30 ; wifi restart' in the
file /etc/rc.local, I have also written a slightly less crude hotplug.d
script that attempts to restart the wifi interface, if the node finds
itself 'authorized' but not 'authenticated' on the adhoc network.  I've
attached that script to this email, and you can save it on a node as *
/etc/hotplug.d/firewall/20_mesh_auth_check*.

Please note this is not a 100% effective solution, as the problem is not
just with a newly powered on node not consistently authorizing itself, but *
also* with some of the existing nodes in the adhoc network not consistently
authorizing the new node on their end too.  That is, I've seen instances
where node A lists node B as both 'authenticated' and 'authorized', but
where node B lists node A as 'authenticated' and *not* 'authorized.'  Oy.

So, when a new node joins an RSN-encrypted adhoc network, it looks like the
following steps must happen to ensure all nodes are authorized:

A. Newly powered-up node inspects output of 'iw wlan0 station dump' looking
for entries where a remote node is 'authenticated' but *not* 'authorized,'
and if so, restart the wifi and retry test.  Ideally, the node would repeat
this process X times until giving up.  The script I'm attaching tries to do
this, albeit without the option to give up after X times.

B. All existing nodes periodically via cronjob check their own local output
of 'iw wlan0 station dump', looking for new entries where a new remote node
is 'authenticated' but *not* 'authorized,'  If such an entry is found,
restart the *local* node's wifi and retry test.

Having both of these steps occur simultaneously on all nodes clearly could
lead to lots of ugly race conditions, so it's not ideal.  Likewise, its
even less ideal for a particular node with active clients to restart its
wifi just because a new node powered on, but didn't get successfully
authorized.  Maybe an alternate way to achieve step B is just to have the
newly powered-up node repeatedly restart its wifi *until* it can
successfully ping all other nodes that appear on the adhoc network, tho
would be tedious and make startup very slow.

1300,Commotion-dev, Android stick-PCs as a potential,"Thu, 25 Apr 2013 09:18:06 +0930",+0930,Paul Gardner-Stephen,"Hello,

The question of ad-hoc mode remains unanswered on the MK808B that we have
here.
As mentioned, it should be possible with some work, due to the use of a
broadcom 4330 chipset.
It is a public holiday here, so I can't try getting ad-hoc on it right now.

However, as I mentioned, I think a good longer-term strategy would be to
work with one of the suppliers to make one using an atheros wi-fi chipset,
so that we have the same happy goodness as on many of the OpenWRT devices
-- but at the attractive price-point of these stick PCs.

Also, getting power consumption down to ~1W makes a big difference for
rechargeable/solar deployments, which I think will be important for both
Commotion and Serval.

Thanks so much for your thoughtful reply re: IBSS-RSN. It looks like we are seeing the same behavior. When I am back at my primary workspace tomorrow I am going to go through the script that you sent. I've left a test running overnight with debugging enabled to see if I can get some ""bad output"" from wpa_supplicant. I will let you know what I find, if anything!

I've been playing around a little with the Commotion OpenWrt firmware.  
Thank you for the work.  I really like what you did with it, the 
automatic configuration makes it very easy to have something working and 
it's certainly a great step to make mesh networking accessible to the 
general public.

I was wondering how easy it would be to make Commotion support other 
mesh protocols.  Here in Montreal, Reseau Libre runs on babel.  We are 
slowly building our own firmware but using Commotion would jump us many 
steps ahead :D  Would it just be a matter of removing olsr and 
installing the babeld package instead or are the new packages you 
developed dependent on olsr?

Thanks,
Genevi?ve

I've actually initiated LimeMicro open-source efforts while developing
our UmTRX and I gave them an idea of MyriadRF, so I decided to
comment:

 1. MyriadRF can't really be compared to HackRF, because MyriadRF is
basically a dev.board and needs a carrier board to communicate to a
computer. HackRF is a finished product which you just need to plug
into a PC.
 2. UmTRX and BladeRF are built using the same chip as MyriadRF.
 3. HackRF is half-duplex. MyriadRF, UmTRX and BladeRF are full-duplex.

There are other differences, but the ones above are most important to
understand.

It's got ethernet, a USB host port, and this is where it gets

It would not be that difficult to add babel to CommotionWRT. The way
that OLSRd is currently configured on CommotionWRT is that a hotplug
script in /etc/hotplug.d/ configures and starts OLSRd when a Commotion
interface starts. Although it wouldn't include some of OLSRd's LuCI web
interface tools, you could get babel running by including a babel
hotplug script that checks for babel's presence and configures it
appropriately when an interface starts. If you want to work on such a
script, I would be happy to provide feedback and integrate it upstream
when it's done. We'd like to support babel and other protocols, and it's
just been a matter of time and resources for me and some of the other
developers.

1311,Commotion-dev, Freifunk watchdog,"Tue, 30 Apr 2013 12:18:42 -0400",-0400,Dan Staples,"Also, Freifunk-watchdog is really controlling when it comes to the
wireless interfaces. When commotiond is in the middle of setting
everything up, ffwatchd will intervene and shut down the wireless
interfaces because the BSSID or channel doesn't match what's in
/etc/config/wireless at that particular moment. And that's a pain in the
ass.

So while ffwatchd is good at keeping processes alive, we need to figure
out how to prevent it from messing up the networking. I propose
modifying /etc/init.d/network to include this start function (changes in
bold):

start() {
        stop
        [ -e /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern ] && {
                ulimit -c unlimited
                echo '/tmp/%e.%p.%s.%t.core' > /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
        }
        service_start /sbin/netifd

        setup_switch() { return 0; }

        include /lib/network
        setup_switch

        sleep 5

        *cp /etc/crontabs/root**/etc/crontabs/root.backup**
**       sed -i -e '/ffwatchd running/d' /etc/crontabs/root**
**       /etc/init.d/freifunk-watchdog stop*

        /sbin/wifi down

        *mv /etc/crontabs/root.backup /etc/crontabs/root**
**       /etc/init.d/freifunk-watchdog start*

Would this be sufficient for keeping ffwatchd from meddling with the
wireless interfaces as commotiond configured everything and/or when
networking was (re)started?

1312,Commotion-dev, Guardian Project Summary of DC Work Days,"Tue, 30 Apr 2013 13:14:41 -0400",-0400,Hans-Christoph Steiner,"
I wrote up a summary of the past Thursday and Friday work session for the
Guardian teams, I thought I'd also post it here, for anyone who is interested:

https://code.commotionwireless.net/projects/commotion/wiki/Hackday-DC-desktop-devs

Bradley Greenwood and Josh Steiner of Scal.io, together with David Oliver and
Hans-Christoph Steiner of Guardian Project, spent two days working at New
America Foundation/OTI's DC office.  They are wrapping up their ""DR1"" release
of the router software, so this meeting was basically a kick-off meeting for a
full push on getting mesh support on desktop and mobile.  This is building
upon the work we initially did on the Android client, and then continued on
GNU/Linux NetworkManager and Mac OS X.  Scal.io is taking on a preliminary
round on Windows.  There was also some discussion on the feasibility of an iOS
app.

OTI has been recently focusing on building up test infrastructure and a couple
small real world deployments, focused on community wifi.  While community wifi
is not Guardian Project's interest in Commotion, it will provide valuable
experience for all of the potential uses for mesh.  They have also been
working with a university lab to building up amazing infrastructure for
testing real world wifi/mesh conditions, with a giant scriptable system for
moving around real devices like Android phones and Windows laptops around
static mesh nodes.  This will provide the first public test data that I know
of that address situations that align directly with Guardian Project
(protests, impromptu networks, etc).

We managed to mostly nail down a plan to get the Android MeshTether client
deployed to as many devices as possible.  We came up with a two stage plan:
spend a week polishing what we have, and get it into the Play Store ASAP.
Then build upon the sketch for the official adhoc support API, while also
providing a new, improved adhoc mode framework for supporting older devices.
Lastly, OTI has taken on lobbying Google directly to get adhoc mode fully
supported in Android.  We've already had promising feedback and are working to
deliver a concrete plan to be approved by Google.

The next big step at OTI is to figure out ideas about a ""Commotion API"" which
would provide an easy way to build network applications that take advantage of
the unique  features a mesh can provide.  There are two core pieces to this:
locality inherent to mesh, and delay-resistant networking.

For locality, its easy to control the reach of a network service, in terms of
physical space, by limiting how many hops the network traffic is allows to go:
1 hop is people in the same room, 3 hops would be neighbors, 4 hops would be a
neighborhood, etc.

As for Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN), this is a specific new network
protocol, different than TCP or UDP, so for it to be useful, an app would need
to have a DTN mode that is based on the DTN API.  While its technically
possible to use DTN transparently via TCP/IP, its not currently useful for a
variety of reasons.

1315,Commotion-dev, nailing down the default mesh network,"Wed, 01 May 2013 16:17:08 -0400",-0400,Hans-Christoph Steiner,"
One idea that we discussed at the last dev sprint last Thursday/Friday is
nailing down a default mesh profile that we can set everywhere.  The core idea
is that people can use this as the easiest way to get started, and also, it
can serve as the mesh config for impromptu meshing.

Currently, we have been using this:

SSID: commotionwireless.net
BSSID: 02:CA:FF:EE:BA:BE
Channel: 5
IP range: 5.0.0.0/255.0.0.0

There are two issues that we need to address in order to nail down this
default profile: a valid IP range, and perhaps a unique BSSID.

5.0.0.0/255.0.0.0 is an officially allocated block of IPs that is actually
deployed in some places.  We should use an IP block that is officially
allocated for uses like Commotion intends.  We discussed this, and it seems
like the best bet is to use one of the RFC1918 private network ranges (10/8,
172.16/12, and 192.168/16).  172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255 seems to be the least
used of the three.  It privdes 1,048,576 unique IP addresses, so plenty.

We might want to consider using 100.64.0.0/10, which is reserved for ""carrier
grade NAT"", i.e. a large scale NATed network that is attached to the internet.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network#Dedicated_space_for_Carrier_Grade_NAT_deployments

The rules for using it are in RFC 6598:
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6598


As for the BSSID, I think we should probably use a unique BSSID to prevent
collisions with other mesh networks.  02:ca:ff:ee:ba:be is used by a number of
other meshes.  It really could be any valid adhoc BSSID like 02:02:02:02:02:02

Whichever IPv4 address block we choose, we'll have to come up with a

With the 5.0.0.0/8 network (and this would work with 10.0.0.0/8), it

All IPv6 would be great!  It sounds like a steep hill to get over since few
people have any experience with IPv6.  So I think we should also set an IPv4
default mesh set, since that's widely deployed and understood.

As for ""borrowing"" any officially assigned IP range, its really a bad idea.
The internet is based on people following the rules on a voluntary basis, and
that is part of the beauty.  As Commotion and Serval, there is no internet
police, and though both Commotion and Serval are violating the rules, no one
has been arrested or detained.  Let's keep the internet working based on
respect for the rules. Please voluntarily follow the rules, so that we don't
end up with internet police.  This should not be hard since there is no good
reason to avoid using IP ranges that have been allocated for uses like this.

Sounds like the ""carrier grade NAT"" RFC6598 100.64.0.0/10 was specifically
allocated for this kind of use case, and covers all the requirements that I've
heard for mesh.  Otherwise the RFC1918 private, non-routable ranges will work.

With Serval we decided to go with 28.0.0.0/254.0.0.0 to give ~32 million
addresses.  This range is US DoD internal use, and as far as we are aware
is not connected to the internet.  Also, as connections to the net from a
mesh are almost always using NAT, the likelihood of issues is further
reduced.  In fact, since a mesh is effectively a separate network from the
internet that happens to have gateways to the internet you are free to use
whatever range you like.  However, as you have indirectly noted using
address ranges that people might try to connect to on the internet causes
complications for most clients.

We went for such a large range because it allows for random self-allocation
of addresses even for relatively large networks.  The Birthday Paradox
implies that you need >=n^2 addresses to allow n nodes to randomly self
allocate addresses while keeping the probability of an address collision
<<0.5.  This makes it feasible to remove one typically annoying and error
prone step of mesh deployment, i.e., address allocation and management.

Having 2^25 addresses allows for 2^(12.5) nodes = ~5,800 nodes without
worrying about the Birthday Paradox.  Probably an overkill for now, but not
if you support mobile nodes, where address collisions are almost certain to
occur.  This is also why we adopted our overlay addressing scheme with 256
bit addresses so that at the end of the day, it wouldn't matter what
address people self-allocated.  But for Commotion one of the primary goals
is internet connectivity, and so using the Serval overlay addressing scheme
as primary transport would require some work around creating an MDP
transported transparent proxy -- not impossible, but probably not something
that needs to happen until you start getting larger deployments with many
mobile devices.

As for IPv6, I am not convinced that it is necessary or that good an idea.
Before explaining my position it is important to confess that I am in many
ways an IPv6 skeptic, several of the reasons for which will become apparent
below.  But generally I take the view that if IPv6 really is that good,
then we would have more widely adopted it in the 18 years (!) since it was
released. Instead, all it does is offer more addresses in a generally
backward-incompatible way, and several peripheral features that were
already solved in IPv4, admittedly with less elegance.  But I digress.

Compiling in IPv6 to a kernel adds some extra flash and RAM use that might
be an issue on smaller devices, but that is a diminishing concern.
The bigger issue is requiring every device that connects to support IPv6.
 This can be managed by allowing clients to connect with IPv4, and thus
just using the IPv6 for mesh traffic between nodes.
IPv6 is only necessary in that role when networks get very large (>~5,800
nodes if you use 28.0.0.0/7). In the meantime, the larger IPv6 headers will
consume precious bandwidth.

So IPv6 can make sense if you want to future-proof yourself for what I
would call ""intermediate sized"" mesh networks.

But once you start thinking about global-scale mobility and >=1 node per
person, the Birthday Paradox starts to be an issue for IPv6, because there
are only 64-bits of host address, which means only 2^32 nodes can safely
randomly self-allocate addresses.  MAC-based address allocation is not
safe, because MAC addresses just aren't unique.

Finally, from Serval's perspective using IPv6 didn't answer the important
question of security, and how to get automatic and fully-distributed
end-to-end encryption between nodes.  This is why we made the overlay
addressing scheme using 256-bit ECC public keys as network addresses.  That
way we get enough addresses for 2^128 nodes (almost enough for every atom
in the planet to randomly self-allocate an address).

We then combined that with address abbreviation to have typical address
lengths in packets of <32bits.  This is important for using low-bandwidth
links like packet radio where links might be between 1kbit - 128kbit, and
where IPv6 headers can consume a significant fraction of that.  Using a
user-land overlay also makes it much easier to use serial packet radios,
because we don't need to expose it as a system network interface, and worry
about things like ARP and goodness knows what consuming the precious little
bandwidth.

Of course the applications of each project differ slightly, and this will
have significant impact on what is most suitable in each case, but
hopefully having an understanding of the decisions we made will be of some
use as Commotion works through these same issues.

I prefer a true (pseudo-)random BSSID. Could be hash over SSID&channel.

I'm afraid there is no ideal solution for addressing. Short term: some v4 space. More fundamental: auto-generated IPv6 ULA and with support for v4 traffic. With IPv6, multi-homing with multi-path is much easier to implement (routing based on source address).

Unfortunately, the current developer for freifunk-watchdog stated there
isn't any documentation for that tool, and probably will never be.  This
means changes could be silently pushed into these tools, with end users not
discover them until after their configuration breaks after OS upgrade.
Possibly, this problem applies for the other freifunk tools packaged into
OpenWRT, too.

Here is the source repo for the various freifunk tools presently packaged
into AA, including the freifunk-watchdog package.

Kludging Commotion tools to accommodate ffwatchd's eccentricities isn't an
appealing option in the long time, especially if the original dev decides
later to silently push more changes that subsequently break Commotion's
kludges, or that beget even uglier kludges.

Could I recommend one of these alternatives?

   1. Propose patches to the luci.subsignal to add UCI config options
   allowing the user to enable/disable whether watchdog touches any wireless
   interfaces.  Hopefully, the original developer would welcome the increased
   attention.
   2. If luci.subsignal.org doesn't accept patches, fork the freifunk tools
   into a git repo managed by OTI, with the patches described in #1.
   3. Don't use the Freifunk tools all.  This options is unappealing, but
   it does at least avoid having to make possibly unsustainable kludges.

1326,Commotion-dev, nailing down the default mesh network,"Fri, 3 May 2013 08:10:37 +0930",+0930,Paul Gardner-Stephen,"Hello,

While it is true that all needs to match to get multi-hop connectivity
through the mesh, if BSSID + channel match (or even channel is +/- 2) then
single-hop traffic will be possible between nodes of different meshes,
which can still be helpful and transfer/share useful information.  Rhizome
could certainly use this kind of connection to transfer data.

Changing the BSSID doesn't reduce the interference of colocated meshes, it
just stops the packets from being visible to each other.  To my mind
forcing separation of traffic like this is counter-productive to the goals
of distributed communications.  In short, I prefer the ""if in doubt, allow
communications"" approach.

So I agree with the doctor that the BSSID should not change.

I like the idea that Paul outlines about letting communications, as long as it
doesn't cause problems.  It sounds like Jeremy is saying it can cause
problems, like if two meshes with different LinkQualityAlgorithms are on the
same channel/BSSID, the olsrds might feed each other bad info and corrupt the
other meshes.  Is that what you're thinking Jeremy?

Deterministic BSSID generation is a good thing, and we did briefly try to
push this general idea into the 802.11 working group in the IEEE.  It great
advantages in reducing the possibility for cell splits which are a real

Do you have any thoughts on how we should structure Commotion feature
ports for Linux and Mac? For instance, if we wanted to pull in servald,
how should we structure the repos and install scripts relative to
commotion-mesh-applet and commotion-meshbook?

On the OpenWRT side we define a commotion feed with Makefiles for each
feature that add and build the correct branches. (See setup.sh in the
commotion-openwrt repo, which calls
https://github.com/opentechinstitute/commotion-feed). Can we apply a
similar model here?

We kind of touched on this during the developers meeting, but I don't
think anything was decided in practical terms.

How this stuff is packaged and included is going to vary quite a bit depending
on platform.  For example, on GNU/Linux, servald and commotiond should just be
their own stand-alone native packages (ie. Debian .deb, RedHat .rpm, etc.),
then there can be a 'commotion' package which installs olsrd,
commotion-mesh-panel, servald, etc.

I imagine that Windows and Mac will be similar to each other, in that they
will be something like an app that includes all of the needed binaries.

The actual build process will vary even more, since XCode is what everyone
uses on Mac, Makefiles are the standard GNU/Linux way of building, and Windows
has other common scenarios.  I think forcing each platform into a standard
cross-platform build technique would be a mistake since it would make it
harder for people to get started building and working on the code because
they'd have to learn an unfamiliar project structure.

We just ran out of money to stay involved in the process.  This was in
large part due to the IEEE meetings mostly being in North America, while we
are in Australia, within 2,000 miles of the antipode of most meetings.
 This would be great to have another more local group come in and push for
that and general fixing of ad-hoc Wi-Fi.

Sounds like a natural role for OTI, if they are amenable, since OTI is also
steeped in policy.  Updating the official IEEE adhoc mode for mesh sounds very
valuable!

Yes, this would be great if OTI could take up the baton on this.  If anyone
is interested in doing so, we can provide some hand-over for where we got
to etc.  The working group were positive about the BSSID from hash of SSID
approach, as I recall.

1342,Commotion-dev, How to file issue on Commotion-OpenWRT luci theme -,"Sun, 5 May 2013 20:52:44 -0500",-0500,Ben West,"Hi All,

This is the current repo for the luci-commotion-theme used for the luci web
UI packaged into Commotion-OpenWRT (forked from a repo started by Ben
Chodoroff):
https://github.com/opentechinstitute/commotion-openwrt-theme

A difficulty I've encountered in squeezing things onto finite flash chips,
especially with recent integration of large packages like Serval, is that
the Commotion theme is really rather large.  Indeed, 10x larger than the
stock themes provided with OpenWRT:

ben at computer:~/blahblah/openwrt/bin/ar71xx/packages$ ls -l *theme*
-rw-r--r-- 1 ben ben  24940 May  5 16:25 luci-theme-base_0.11.1-1_ar71xx.ipk
-rw-r--r-- 1 ben ben  13649 May  5 16:25
luci-theme-bootstrap_0.11.1-1_ar71xx.ipk

-rw-r--r-- 1 ben ben   7951 May  5 16:25
luci-theme-openwrt_0.11.1-1_ar71xx.ipk

Jumping into the theme's internals, it looks like the lion's share
(440kbytes, or 60% of overall ipk) comes from fronts:

ben at computer:~/blahblah/openwrt/build_dir/target-mips_r2_uClibc-0.9.33.2/luci-theme-commotion-master/files/htdocs$

Is the use of the Asap font critical to UX or HID design elements?  Could
the CSS be edited to instead use whatever built-in sens-serif font the
user's browser supplies?

Also, the repo for the Commotion theme isn't set up to accept issue
submissions from the public.  May I be added to the access list to submit
an issue (evtl followed up with pull request) about slimming this theme
down in size?

Thanks.

Zepto functionality degrades in ie9 and below, so i set it up to fall 
back to jQuery in that case - only one of the two libraries is served 
to the client

One could feasibly pull out jquery if it were possible to test the 
interface in ie9 and below without the zepto function calls.

I agree about ditching Asap. Also, many of the images could be removed 
or at least simplified and compiled into sprites.

Looks nice.  It would be great if it had multiple wifi radios so that it could
be an AP and a mesh node, or relay open wifi over a mesh, and things like that.

The commercial grade multi-radio mesh APs usually rely on external antennae

coax cable, and external aerials, all of which drives the cost of such
devices to a multiple of what UBNT sells their single-radio units for.

UBNT's scheme for powering a Nanostation and a slave device off the same
POE supply does go a little bit towards making multi-radio ""supernodes""
more cost-effective, but one can only combine two devices reliably with
this method.

If devices like the BRCK could go through more extreme cost optimization
(aka 'Muntzing'), then maybe the cost per unit becomes cheap enough that
simply chaining together two BRCKs, each operating on a different band, is
a practical way to build supernodes.

I have reached out to the BRCK guys to talk about potentially merging PCB
designs with our planned Mesh Extender, as all we need are some headers to
attach the UHF packet radio, and hopefully they are already using an
Atheros Wi-Fi chipset.

has been causing instability for the DR1 testing release of
Commotion-OpenWRT. So I've set about replacing it with Nodogsplash
(http://kokoro.ucsd.edu/nodogsplash/ [thanks for the suggestion, Ben!]),
and adding a LuCI configuration page for it and a custom Commotion
splash page. It's now ready for an initial component release and further
testing.

I've tested a brand new DR1 Picostation image with Commotion-splash, and
it works great. If anyone wants a demo (in person or virtual), I can
show you tomorrow or whenever. There was one issue that I saw today, in
which nodogsplash reports using enormous amounts of memory ('VSZ') in
top, in fact sometimes more than 100% of the reported available memory.
Yet, the node still appears to have around the same amount of free
memory as other DR1 nodes not running nodogsplash, and there have been
no stability issues. So it could be just a fluke. If it doesn't cause
problems, I'm not going to worry...

I transferred ownership of the commotion-splash repo to OTI, and
submitted pull requests for commotion-openwrt, luci-commotion, and
commotion-feed, if any other OTI folks can review those.

What's left is to come up with a solution for captive-portalling when no
internet access is available (since nodogsplash can't man-in-the-middles
HTTP requests when clients can't first resolve DNS queries). Josh King
and I talked today about the possibility of running a second instance of
dnsmasq to man-in-the-middle DNS requests for preauthenticated users.
Hopefully that will work.

W/r/t to memory usage, do note that most any bandwidth throttling
implementation, whether nodogsplash or the qos-scripts package, is
ultimately using buckets to maintain the speed control on clients'
sessions.  These buckets exist in memory, with faster bandwidth caps
effectively being larger buckets that empty faster.

So the effectiveness of the bandwidth throttling depends on the amount
available memory, with insufficient memory causing observed clients'
bandwidth to degrade.

Still, I've generally had good success operating nodogsplash and
coovachilli on nodes with 32MB RAM, and on average 2-3 simultaneous clients
each with a 3Mbit/s cap.

This except from a recent post to the OpenWRT-users list describes the
current issue with nodogsplash not supporting bandwidth throttling any
more.  (Sorry, I had only last tested NDS with Backfire).

""I have a captive portal using the nodogsplash package to share
3mbps/200kbps with my neighbours using the nodogsplash capabilities to
limit the bandwidth usage, but the bandwidth limitation feature depend on
the package iptables-mod-imq which it is no longer available in attitude
ajustment. I think it has been replaced by IFB.

""As I have some spare time now I was planning to upgrade my router to
attitude ajustment just to take a look at the new release but as the
package iptables-mod-imq is no longer available I suppose I can?t limit the
bandwidth usage in the captive portal if I use nodogsplash.

""does anyone knows if there is any way to configure a captive portal in
aptitude ajustment with download/upload bandwidth limitation alternative to
nodogsplash? or any way to get iptables-mod-imq working in attitude
ajustment so I can continue using nodogsplash? or any way to make
nodogplash to use IFB?""

I can confirm that coovachilli still does bandwidth throttling fine in
Attitude Adjustment.

The git repo that Outback is quoting does indeed contain a refreshed copy
of NDS (hurray!), but I'm unsure yet if the changes pushed to that repo
update the portal to use IFB instead of IMQ for throttling.

I heard it was crashing repeatedly last year and didn't improve much
since than, even in their proprietary version. So I would be glad if
it was an OsmoBTS. At least it's stable. I've changed my preference to
Osmocom projects for a lot of reasons. I'll tell more at the meeting

1373,Commotion-dev, Preventing Commotion nodes from handing out DHCP?,"Tue, 14 May 2013 16:52:49 -0400",-0400,Preston Rhea,"Hello dev team,

Tomorrow, we are going up the Visitation Rectory steeple in Red Hook
to install a co-ordinated distribution layer and Commotion layer
co-location site. BKFiber will install some stock 5GHz and 900MHz
equipment at the top of the steeple, we'll put two Commotion
NanoStations in the middle of the steeple, and all will be connected
by a Ubiquiti ToughSwitch.

The issue: we want the Commotion nodes to not interfere with DHCP
leases. Those should all be left up to the BKfiber infrastructure - we
need to ensure that the Commotion nodes can only receive, never give
out, DHCP leases. This is in line with our multi-layer approach, with
a Commotion community-managed layer hanging off of a
professionally-managed distribution layer. So even if the power goes
out, this should always be the case when the power comes back on.

The question: What exactly should I do to make this happen on the
Commotion nodes? If you can email a precise solution, it will A: help
me since I will be in the steeple all day, and B: help us turn it into
nice documentation for the future.

1375,Commotion-dev, Preventing Commotion nodes from handing out,"Wed, 15 May 2013 07:07:22 +0930",+0930,Paul Gardner-Stephen,"Hello,

To clarify my understanding, is the following understanding correct:

1. You want to disable issuing of DHCP leases by the Commotion kit when the
BKFiber stuff is connected. This is pretty clear.

2. When the power is off, only the Commotion kit is running.

3. When only the Commotion kit is running, you want it to hold onto DHCP
leases for long enough that service is maintained until the power comes
back on.

?

Or do you want to offer DHCP from the Commotion kit, but only when the
power is off?
Only from the same ranges as the BKFiber kit?
Only from ranges that don't conflict with the BKFiber kit?
With very short leases so that when the power comes back on you can stop
offering them, and they will expire within a few minutes, so that normal
service can resume?
You want the Commotion kit to hoard BKFiber DHCP-issued addresses for
distribution on the local network when the power goes down?

Paul.

To prevent these nodes from ever giving out DHCP leases, forever and for
all time, it should be enough to remove DNSMasq (""opkg remove dnsmasq""),
since that is the program that hands out DHCP leases. But then it can
still request/receive DHCP leases. Best of luck tomorrow!

*shielded* cat5 cable with cat5 surge arrestors?  I'm guessing that steeple
is the tallest structure for at least a few blocks, so it will be getting
visits from lightening.  The steeple should have rods up top and thick
ground cable to divert direct strikes, but you'll still want shielded cable
to prevent induced surge from fusing the ethernet chips.  I did just
recently retrieve a Nanostation M5 from a 3rd floor roof whose primary LAN
port burned out, presumably since I installed it using unshielded cable a
couple years ago.

Also, removing dnsmasq does indeed remove exactly that which would issue
DHCP leases.  However, do you know that the 10.x.x.x, 101.x.x.x, 102.x.x.x,
etc subnets which the Commotion nodes must route will be the same for all
use cases?  That is, the NAT thru the nodes generally assumes traffic
entering each interface to have a source IP within one of the subnets
configured, independent of who is giving out DHCP leases.

P.S. BKFiber looks pretty cool as a local WISP.  Is anyone on this list in
good rapport with them?  Discussions on other OTI lists about meshy
business models piques my curiosity w/r/t/ what BKFiber is up to.

I do not have a node in front of me at the moment so I can't tell for
certain (I am referencing my home router, which is running a different
version of OpenWRT), but you should be able to set this fairly easily
through the LuCI admin interface. In the admin interface, just go to
Network->Interfaces->Plug. There should be a dropdown menu for
""Protocol."" Switch it to ""DHCP Client,"" and click ""Switch Protocol.""
This will remove the ethernet interface from Commotion's configuration,
and instead it will just be a normal DHCP interface. Is the node
intended to advertise that interface as a gateway?

I think that Josh made an excellent, easy suggestion. In fact, it is so good and obvious that my planned response now looks silly. 

Since Josh's suggestion will do the trick, feel free to stop reading. But, if you're interested here's how I was going to respond:

I pulled up the function that sets the interface information for a Commotion Plug type interface. That's in /lib/network/commotion.sh. You can view the file through the web here: https://github.com/opentechinstitute/commotion-openwrt/blob/master/commotionfeed/commotionbase/files/lib/network/commotion.sh 

Check down to line 519. We need to change the parameters to udhcpc (stored in the variable $dhcpopts). The existing options (-q -n) tell udhcpc to attempt to obtain a dhcp lease and a) exit immediately after a lease is obtained and b) exit and return failure if a lease cannot be obtained. In your case, the desired behavior is be for udhcpc to continuously ask for a lease until it gets one and then continue to refresh that lease periodically. To do that we just let udhcpc do its default behavior by removing those options entirely. Line 519 becomes
local dhcpopts=""""

That's not enough, though. We need to also tell remainder of the function to execute the code for case 0 (which means that udhcpc successfully got a lease) no matter what. The ""easiest"" way to do that would be to change line 530 to look like:
case ""0"" in

With these changes, the behavior would be 

1) plug interface comes up,
2) udhcpc asks for an IP address and 
3) the plug interface never acts as a dhcp server. 

In essence, this is exactly what Josh's suggestion accomplishes. I will defer to Josh on the implications for his suggestion w.r.t. to olsrd. There may be some special ""stuff"" that has to happen for networks on the plug interfaces to get into hna for olsrd. 

I hope that this was helpful and not rambling. Please keep us posted tomorrow if you need help. We'll be around on IRC, etc.

I just realized that udhcpc might not ever go into the background without using the -b option. The -b option means ""Background if lease is not immediately obtained"". This is definitely what we want, but I can't say for sure whether the option is necessary or not. If udhcpc never goes into the background, the node will sit there waiting to complete its boot process until it gets a lease. A problem indeed.

And, just to be clear,

a) Josh is the expert,
b) My suggestions are untested, 
c) I'm trying to be helpful, and
d) Josh is the expert. :-)

1383,Commotion-dev, Preventing Commotion nodes from handing out,"Wed, 15 May 2013 11:14:03 -0400",-0400,Josh King,"Hi Preston,

If you are connecting to the router over ethernet, then if it fails to
get a lease on the DHCP interface then the interface will not come up,
which includes the 192.168.1.20 alias. You'll need to put it on a
network where it can get a DHCP lease, give it a lease from your laptop,
or connect to it over wireless.

I'm realizing that this configuration - DHCP client mode, and AP turned off
- may be a catch-22 since it will be only possible to access these nodes
over the mesh.

Sorry, I should have anticipated that you might need to shut off the AP 
as well.

One possibility that I forgot to mention is that, depending on the 
state of the plug interface previously, it might end up in the wrong 
firewall zone. I don't know that that would result in what you're 
seeing, but it might. In addition to the previous steps, on what I 
believe is the same page where you switch the protocol, make sure that 
the ethernet interface is in firewall zone ""WAN.""

So I have been working on the ""learnable mesh"" problem for most Sunday

This is a somewhat long e-mail so I have  surrounded the actual
questions with the html tag <question> for parsing, though I know that

The most important aspect of helping a user ""learn"" about mesh, is a
short feedback loop for users who are customizing their device. In
working with our mesh glossary this weekend I came to the realization
that the most important component to our connectivity based tool is the
interface. To this end, I need to identify a way for a user to interact
with a virtual wireless interface freely without cutting off the
interface they are connected to the device with. This configuration
interface can either be another virtual interface or another physical
one (like ethernet.) Once, we get the desktop and mobile clients this
will not be as much of an issue as the user will not be using a network

I hope everyone agrees IPv6 is the best way to go .)

End-users won't notice any difference, except for the rare case of
someone trying to manually type their IP number to connect to from
another machine or something. But preferrably hostnames would be used
for this!

So, what changes would have to be made to run Commotion with an IPv6 setup?
 * olsrd apparently supports it (but I haven't tried it out myself)
 * A bunch of uci/luci configurations must be modified, I guess?

For addressing, I believe the link-local fe80::/10 network would work
well - which tends to be automatically configured for any ipv6 enabled
network interface. The method is based on something called EUI-64 and
generates an address based on the MAC with some distinctiveness for
local logic:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6_address#Modified_EUI-64

Looking at my current Commotion node, my wlan0 and wlan0-1 interfaces
have two distinct IPv6 link-local addresses:
wlan0           inet6 addr: fe80::dc9f:dbff:fe0e:c0bb/64 Scope:Link
wlan0-1         inet6 addr: fe80::d89f:dbff:fe0e:c0bb/64 Scope:Link

The above is given by a MAC address of DA:9F:DB:0E:C0:BB

So what would have to be stored is probably just which interface is
which (mesh, ap, secureap) and then have olsrd work only on the mesh. So

1403,Commotion-dev, Torouter on Commotion,"Mon, 20 May 2013 18:08:04 -0400",-0400,Dan Staples,"Updating the OpenWRT Tor package to the latest stable versions would be 
a benefit for everyone :)

And making a LuCI interface could be useful, but there would be more to 
it than that. Did you talk to Stephanie about what she implemented? 
When we discussed the possibility of using Tor in Commotion, there were 
some factors brought up for consideration:

1. How would the end user use it? Would it be a specific access point 
on Commotion-OpenWRT that provided a transparent proxy through the Tor 
network?
2. If so, how do we manage the information leak risks that would 
otherwise be addressed by using the Tor browser bundle?
3. If we provide a transparent proxy to the Tor network, how do we 
handle local traffic for mesh-only services?
4. How would this be implemented in Commotion client software (android, 
linux, mac, windows)?

I have managed to successfully compile and run an updated copy (v2.6.0) of
the cyassl embedded SSL implementation, and furthermore have libcurl / curl
link to that instead of libopenssl.

If you have to use SSL (which is recommended when you want to connect to a
remote service, e.g. a dashboard), libcyassl saves you 500Kbytes+ of flash
space over libopenssl:
-rw-r--r-- 1 ben ben 105802 May 18 22:37

-rw-r--r-- 1 ben ben 637545 May 18 23:14
bin/ar71xx/packages/libopenssl_1.0.1e-1_ar71xx.ipk

Although, Commotion doesn't using openssl or cyassl for anything in
particular yet, besides the onboard web-server uhttpd, do you plan to build
any service which will require SSL?  If so, I've cyassl + libcurl patches

I've been having problems with a node that consistently powers up with
local time @ 1 Jan 1970, getting its OLSR packets rejected by other nodes
with correct local time.  Henning seems to confirm this is done
intentionally by OLSRd for security reasons, creating a potential
chicken-and-egg problem for any nodes that depend on a getting a valid
route via OLSR to set their local time in the first place.

This particular node is a TP-Link TL-MR3020, although I believe the UBNT
radios are a little better about powering up with their local time not
quite as old as Disco.

Anyhoo, the hack I've put into /etc/rc.local is quoted below.  Basically,
it takes the most recent file modification date under
/etc/somewhere/current and sets local time to that.  For Commotion, if the
local time issue affects you, you could probably set the path just to
""/etc"".

1409,Commotion-dev, Fwd: Hack to set node's local time on boot in,"Tue, 21 May 2013 12:52:20 -0500",-0500,Ben West,"Hi Dan,

I do not know what OLSRd's allowable time offset is, and empirical
observation seems to suggest that local time on the order of (T - 3years)
is OK, but (T - 40years) is not.  Henning thought packets older that 30secs
would be rejected, but I have not observed that fine-grained of sensitivity
to local time offset at all.

Besides that, Henning and I are curious if this might be exposing a
variable out-of-range problem somewhere deep in the bowels of OLSRd.
Normally, such problems are expected to surface when the world as Linux
knows it ends in 2038, but possibly this instance involves a variable that
is already offset very far into its allowable range.

UBNT products seems to skirt by this problem for the most point by having a
hardcoded local time at some point well after the UNIX epoch (e.g. date of
chip manufacture?).  Indeed, I only experienced this problem on a TP-Link
node that happens to always power up with local time 1/1/1970, and
occasionally on older Engenius ath5k radios.

1421,Commotion-dev, TPLink w3040,"Sun, 2 Jun 2013 11:18:11 -0500",-0500,Ben West,"Hi Saemus,

I've still been tooling around with squeezing meshing firmware image onto a
similar TP-Link TL-MR3020, which also has 4MB flash.  I'm just about to the
point where I can get the kernel, basic filesystem, and even a coovachilli
captive portal into 4MB, but I've had to do / am doing the following:

- Add the ""-funit-at-a-time"" compile optimiization flag, and use GCC v4.7.
This basically tells GCC to work harder at reducing compiled code size, and
maybe yields 5-10% smaller images.

- Swap out libopenssl for libcyassl for use with curl.  (If you're using
curl.)  I can share the patches for this if you'd like.

- While retaining IPv6 support in the kernel, switch all IPv6-related
packages over to modules not included with the compile image.

- Select ""Compressed source"" or ""Pre-compiled source"" for the luci lua
source files.  Theorectically, this reduces the space used by all the Luci
web UI source files, although I've been able to observe and significant
image size decrease with this.

- Port the IBSS-RSN stuff from hostapd + wpa_supplicant over to one of the
smaller packages like wpad-mini.  (Not done yet.)

Note that installing *.ipk files from a mounted USB drive at boot should be
quite doable, but you will want to make sure you have opk write the
installed files to /tmp or something like that.  Likewise, important
binaries and shared libraries installed to the ramdisk will probably need
to have symlinks pointing to their proper location under / .  (I think the
symlinks can just be stored on the internal root filesystem OK.  They'll
just dangle until opkg installs the necessary files on each boot.)

I'm including the .config file I've used for my TP-Link TL-MR3020 for
reference, although do please bear in mind this wasn't used for compiling
Commotion.  Likewise, my config files so far exclude all USB stuff.

1423,Commotion-dev, Custom Commotion images for Red Hook,"Tue, 04 Jun 2013 18:26:31 -0400",-0400,Dan Staples,"I just finished putting together custom Commotion-OpenWRT DR1 images for
the Red Hook network. These images have the following features:

* Upon flashing the new image, a wireless access point and an
ad-hoc/mesh interface are both brought up by default
* The mesh interface will keep the same 5.x.x.x IP address it had before
flashing, and encryption is turned off so it will mesh with other PR3 nodes
* The default access point has the SSID ""RHIwifi""
* n2n VPN is turned on, and will connect to vpn.commotionwireless.net,
allowing for remote troubleshooting

Once you flash the node, you will need to connect to its web interface
to set the admin password and/or complete the Quick Start wizard. Be
mindful that completing the Quick Start will *turn on encryption* on the
mesh interface, so that it will *no longer mesh with PR3 nodes*. You can
set the admin password without completing the Quick Start.

The images can be found here (I wasn't able to upload them to Redmine):
http://wirelesssummit.org:8000/

For the developers, here are the additions I made:
https://github.com/opentechinstitute/commotion-openwrt/commit/95739178f0f3ca6c2986d785d5c6393a13652ddd.
In the commit message, I reference two fixes that are also required for
the image to work, one for commotiond, and one for quick-start.

Here's a rundown of how I tested them:

1. I had two nodes, A and B, that both had PR3. I connected to A's
access point.
2. I opened my browser and went to B's 5.x.x.x address to get to the web
interface.
3. A captive portaled me, so I clicked ""accept"" and it redirected me to
commotionwireless.net
4. I tried to go to B's 5.x.x.x address again, and this time it worked.
5. I went to System->Backup/Flash Firmware
6. At the bottom of the page, *I *unchecked* ""Keep settings""* (this is
important!!!) and then uploaded the proper image, and flashed the node.
7. After a few minutes, I was able to go to B's web interface at the
same IP address, while still connected through A's access point.
8. I then completed B's Quick Start wizard
9. I repeated the same process for A, and after all was said and done,
they were both upgraded to DR1, and using an encrypted mesh.

I'll be up in Red Hook later this week to help with upgrades, but wanted
to document this for everyone's benefit.

cheers,

1426,Commotion-dev, What's the word on DR1.1?,"Wed, 05 Jun 2013 12:35:25 -0400",-0400,Dan Staples,"I did some quick testing, and here are my results:

I had two picostations wired to my home router, so they were both
internet gateways. The two picostations were sitting about a foot and a
half from each other, and both were about two feet from my home wireless
router. I had laptop A (LA) connected to picostation A's (PA) access
point, about 4 feet apart, and laptop B (LB) connected to picostation
B's (PB) access point, about a foot and a half apart. Clearly, a very
dense network with powerful radios.

For the first test, I had each laptop ping both of the routers for 10
minutes, all at once. I didn't ping out to the internet, since latency
added outside of the Commotion mesh is something that is out of our
hands. Here are the results:


	Picostation A
	Picostation B
Laptop A
	579 packets transmitted, 579 received, 0% packet loss, time 578821ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 3.015/43.496/1077.565/75.168 ms, pipe 2
	573 packets transmitted, 486 received, 15% packet loss, time 573162ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 3.024/70.835/1370.596/104.428 ms, pipe 2
Laptop B
	593 packets transmitted, 593 received, 0% packet loss, time 592896ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 2.254/30.458/337.962/33.694 ms
	587 packets transmitted, 524 received, 10% packet loss, time 587164ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 2.864/58.639/396.346/53.250 ms


I then disconnected PB, had LA ping PA for 10 minutes, then turned off
PA and turned back on PB, and had LB ping PB for 10 minutes:


	Picostation A
	Picostation B
Laptop A
	600 packets transmitted, 600 received, 0% packet loss, time 599589ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 1.286/4.876/180.558/11.671 ms 	
Laptop B
	
	604 packets transmitted, 604 received, 0% packet loss, time 603863ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 1.998/3.715/98.925/4.888 ms


As we can see in even this controlled experiment, disconnecting one of
the nodes significantly reduces ping times. However, definitely not a
latency difference of the scale yall have been reporting in Dharamsala
or Red Hook. Which makes me wonder if the latency issue yall are
experiencing is caused by latency introduced outside of the Commotion
network, past the upstream gateway, or if there are other local factors
involved.

Can yall try a similar test, pinging the local routers instead of the
internet? That will help us figure out whether the issue is localized or
not.

- 2 separate Commotion nodes hanging off the near end of the 5GHz P2P link
from BKFiber
- I unplugged the Nano and then Internet access worked great on the Pico.

How close together physically are the Nano and Pico running DR1.1?  Also, I
assume they're on the same channel too?

Since both Commotion nodes are still operating as wired gateway nodes,
regardless of DHCP settings, I think it's very likely they are interfering
with each other.  I had similar problems (i.e. super long latency) try to
operate more than one node on the same mast on the same channel.

You want to have 2 wired Commotion nodes within very close proximity, they
will either need to operate on different channels, or one will have just be
a repeater node (and with its TX power turned way down).

Tor's is the best that I know. I think it is totally fine to borrow
heavily from their write up, and acknowledge that fact.

Having a page that specifically talks about verifying Commotion, as
opposed to the process of verifying arbitrary files signed with PGP
keys, is probably more useful for Commotion's general documentation
goals.

Though a more general piece might make a fine blog post.

1. AP: Clients can associate but DHCP does not hand out leases.

I believe I am experiencing #2 in your list, as my nodes often reconnect
over olsr when reapplying the Wifi network settings on at least one of
them (haven't debugged more than that yet).

I dropped development on a user interfacefor the QOS work a few weeks
ago and I wanted to give an update in case anyone wants to take it on in
the future.

Looking at various interfaces I think that modifying the Tomato
interface for QOS http://www.easytomato.org/features/scheduled-rules/,
which is based on the Toastman version of Tomato
http://linksysinfo.org/index.php?threads/toastman-releases.36106/, is
the best option for implementing QOS on Commotion. It is currently built
for DD-Wrt, but looking at the scripts it mainly creates TC files, and
as such, would be an easy enough lift to move over to OpenWRT and LuCI.
Though, there will be some extra work fiddling with multiple zone rules.

Below is some useful info from William Dixon at Easy Tomato that I
thought would be useful to append to this if anyone wants to continue
this work.

""One of the really hard parts of this is to automatically figure out
your connection speed without constantly blasting huge amounts of data
over the network (you need your speed for QoS settings and they can
fluctuate a lot during a day).  There are a few ways to do it, but its a
lot of work, but really needs to a grad research project.  We were
hoping research group at GaTech would do it for us, but that's looking
less likely.

This is

portal inoperative.

Do you know what kernel version EasyTomato is bundling?  I believe Tomato
itself is still wedded to kernel v2.6 (or older?) and unfortunately fully
obsolete for the topic at hand.

Besides all that, it may just be simplest to encourage the end user to
input their overall Up/Down bandwidth values into any QOS admin UI form,
rather than having the node itself try to determine that.  It could be a
basic step like ""connect your laptop directly to your Internet connection
and run speedtest.net a few times ...""

Would you mind sending a link to any information you have about IMQ 
inclusion/removal from the kernel? I'm just curious is all!

1449,Commotion-dev, Commotion DR1.1 Release,"Mon, 10 Jun 2013 10:27:53 -0400",-0400,Josh King,"Hi all,

Now that the download page on the main website is updated, I just wanted
to send out the release notes for our latest point release. This should
be the beginning of a more rapid release cycle. You can download DR1.1 at:

https://commotionwireless.net/download

Release notes below:

Commotion DR1.1 Release Notes

Developer Release 1.1 is the first stable release of the DR1 series.
This release is the beginning of our new stable branch, and represents a
significant step forward from our previous stable release.
What is a Commotion release?

Commotion release versions represent a target set of features for the
entire project
(http://code.commotionwireless.net/projects/commotion/wiki/Official_Version_Feature_Targets).
Software packages for individual platforms (Linux, Windows, etc.) may be
in different stages of development, and are labeled according to their
supported features.
Platform Availability:

Currently, only the OpenWRT-based router firmware is DR1 compatible.
Other platforms are under active development and are being brought up to
feature parity. Current platform revisions can be found on the Official
Version Feature Targets page.
Features:

    Easy-to-use setup wizard: The Commotion Quickstart provides a
simple, one-step interface for setting up a Commotion node.

    Local applications: The Commotion Apps Portal is an interface for
creating and browsing for local network applications.

    Common platform for managing settings: The Commotion Daemon provides
a common management interface for maintaining the configurations of
different community networks.

    Encryption tools: Commotion configures industry-standard IBSS-RSN
encryption by default, and provides the Serval crypto API to aid
developers in creating secure applications.

    Consistent visual style: New Commotion releases are all styled in
accordance with the Commotion Human Interface Guidelines
(http://commotionwireless.net/docs/hig/introduction).

    Simplified debugging: A new Commotion Debugging Helper tool makes it
easy to retrieve useful troubleshooting information from a node in the
event of a network problem.

Fixes:

    Innumerable fixes and changes went into this release since Preview
Release 3 (PR3), the previous stable branch. A complete list can be
found on the Commotion project site.

me not being able to connect to the access point. I tried with my
laptop's built-in wifi, and a TP-Link TL-WN821N USB adapter; neither
worked. Adding the 802.11w flag to the ad-hoc interface appeared to have
no effect.

Has anyone else tried using 802.11w? It seems Microsoft has only just
made it available to clients in Windows 8. So perhaps it's not worth
pursuing for Commotion, due to minimal compatibility.

1452,Commotion-dev, Possible hostapd / IBSS-RSN regression on OpenWRT,"Tue, 11 Jun 2013 15:23:34 -0500",-0500,Ben West,"I recompiled some of my firmware stacks to the most current AA version, and
!shazaam! the IBSS-RSN encrypted adhoc stopped working.  This didn't occur
with the Commotion OpenWRT firmware, but the firmware I observed this on is
90% similar.

I think this is the offending changeset:
https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/36682/branches/attitude_adjustment/package/hostapd

AA r36608 is known to work fine.

Note that I use the full hostapd and wpa_supplicant packages for encrypted
adhoc.  I believe Commotion OpenWRT does the same.

I'm away from home and not able to easily test this hypothesis, but I see
the recent hostapd update to AA includes 802.11r functionality:
https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/36533

802.11r, which is now implemented in full hostapd package (as opposed to
hostapd-mini), looks rather useful:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11r-2008

While a regression is indeed still possible, I am actually curious if this
hostapd update just means that nodes running r36682+ will not do IBSS-RSN
encryption with nodes running r36681 and earlier.  Not necessarily that
IBSS-RSN fully broken in r36682+.

MagicNet construction tomorrow and Thursday, we experienced issues with
changing the wireless channel off of 5. We changed it to 11, saved and
applied, and although the menu records the channel as changed, Wi-Fi
analyzer and iwconfig record it as still set to 5.

Will and Dan's deeper examination reveal that the node, upon bringing up
its wireless interface, will always scan channels to see if there is a mesh
to join, and it will join that mesh and set its channel to that mesh's
channel regardless of the choice the user made. Thus far, it seems the
workaround is to bring up the first node in a new mesh in the absence of
any other mesh network, set its channel to the channel you want, then bring
up the other nodes in its presence.

If the Commotion Android app is connected properly and completely to a
mesh, the a general IP network is available between the devices. You can
program your apps as expected over any typical IP network.

The one caveat is that the Android NetworkManager / Connectivity checks
for wifi may not behave the same as you expect, since the mesh is
enabled at a layer below the usual Android APIs for now.

Good luck!

Have you tried 'nc localhost 9090'? You can also check 'netstat -ltpn'
to see if olsrd is listening on port 9090.

Also keep in mind that /var/etc/olsrd.conf is dynamically generated from
/etc/config/olsrd.

I'm curious whether there has been given any thought to roaming between
commotion wireless nodes. I.e. moving from one node to another without
dropping a connection. What would be necessary to enable this and is it
even desirable?

Roaming, I assume, requires a coordinated backbone. This I guess is hard
to impossible to setup in a reliable manner within an open mesh network.
As it is now, every router has its own subnet with NATing and a routing
table, right? This feels natural in an IPv4 network, given the rather
limited address space for unique, routable addresses. So to enable
roaming in the current Commotion environment, one would have to have a
backbone that tracks the connections. Which seems like an unnecessarily
complex thing to do in an open mesh.

With a larger address space (say IPv6) I suppose this would be easier,
as routing of packets between nodes could appear to be on the same
subnet. There'd be retransmissions in TCP of course, but the server my
local client is talking to would always see the same client IP (my IP)
and thus the connection might be laggy but not break at a node-hop.

Of course one would get external connections killed if the gateway
disappears, but internal connections (local applications etc.) would
still function.

So, again, is roaming possible, doable and desirable or not? Or, as it
may be, have I failed to understand some important part of IP routing?

I assume you mean roaming/handoff of non-mesh clients connected to
access points on mesh nodes, yes? Unfortunately, this is currently not
possible, without the type of coordination you describe. As I understand
it, it is a limitation of a layer-3 mesh, such as OLSRd, which we use.
I've heard that a layer-2 mesh, such as Batman-Adv, *can* do seamless
handover of access point clients. But of course, there are lots of other
tradeoffs between layer-2 and layer-3 meshes.

A while ago, I came upon a solution for doing seamless handover for
access point clients, developed by folks at the Distributed System and
Networks Lab @ Johns Hopkins. It's called Smesh: http://www.smesh.org/.
I would love to try to implement this in Commotion, but it would be a
long-term project that we currently don't have anyone working on.

But keep in mind that we are currently ramping up development of
Commotion desktop/mobile mesh client software (linux, android, mac,
windows, iOS), that will let mobile phones and laptops and such become
full-fledged mesh nodes, which will allow for theoretically seamless
roaming, as they will use ad-hoc links instead of access point connections.

1499,Commotion-dev, Using UCI to define static routes on nodes,"Wed, 03 Jul 2013 14:51:46 -0400",-0400,Will Hawkins,"I'm sure that most everyone here knows about this, but it bit me
yesterday and I wanted to post it for posterity (is that redundant?):

OpenWRT users can define static routes on nodes through UCI. In the
/etc/config/network file, it looks something like this:

config route '<optional route name>'
	option interface '<name of interface>'
	option target '<target as dotted quad>'
	option netmask '<netmask in dotted quad>'
	option gateway '<gateway in dotted quad>'

It can also be done through the web interface. Incredibly useful. Here's
where I flubbed it:

Let's say that my plug interface (eth0) is 172.16.0.0/16 but I want to
use 192.168.1.1 as my gateway for a default route through the plug.
Using 'ip', I could do this like:

ip route add 0.0.0.0/0 via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0

However, this type of ""via"" route is not possible using the UCI
configuration. Before applying the static routes from the config, UCI
checks to see if the gateway is in the interface's network range. There
is probably a way around this, but I could not figure it out. Also, as
far as I can tell, there's very little information spit out in the debug
files to tell you about this.

Please, PLEASE, let me know if you've worked through this issue before
and successfully solved it. Otherwise, it's just something to keep in mind!

It could be that UCI can only number interfaces reliably, but not always
set unconventional routes.  Especially since 'plug' is virtual interface
that could take multiple different addresses.

Thanks for your reply. I agree. 'ip route add ...' is far more flexible.
So, I guess we'll attempt to work with that in future. I really wanted
to use ""standard"" UCI in this case just, well, because.

Ah, yes. Handoff/-over is what I mean.

I was thinking that if I am given an IP address unique for the mesh, and
I could keep this whilst connected to any node, wouldn't it be possible
to have packets originating from me be properly routed regardless of
which node I am connected to?

I.e. if when connecting to a wifi node I generate my local IPv6 address
incorporating my MAC address, which can be assumed to be unique. And
when I am then walking to a second access point, losing connection with
the first, I would resend whatever TCP packets not properly sent to the
new AP, effectively re-establishing my connection on the new route.

Though I guess this is where I run into trouble in my train of thought,
as it would perhaps mean that each and every route to each connected
client would have to be propagated over the mesh network in order for
the ""return route"" to my machine to be properly updated.

Sorry if I haven't fully understood low-level implementations of the OSI
model, feel free to point me to documentation if it's too much. I'm
mostly trying to walk myself through the complexities of mesh networking
and asking for some help along the path ;)

No rush in my opinion at least. Seamless handoff is a luxury feature, so
there's no rush in getting it working before anything else .)

Absolutely, I'm following the development closely as we're trying out
the firmware builds here in Ume?, Sweden. .)

Linux Mint Cinnamon, Ubuntu Unity, and Debian GNOME 3.  In theory, it should
also work on GNOME2 and KDE, but I have not tested it there.

To make a DIY base suitable for use on flat rooftops, you can screw
together some lengths of treated lumber into a ""T"", bolt the dish mounting
bracket to it, and then weigh the base down with cinderblocks.

If the rooftop is not your own, do first check with the building owner.  It
can be good diligence to use one of those black rubber mats under the
wooden base to deter rotting away the tarpaper or whatever the roof is

Great info and photo album :)  I also once turned a DirecTV dish into a wifi
antenna.  It was pretty laborious but it seemed to work quite well.

This makes me want to get off the computer and onto roofs!

Is a Debian build set planned? I'm running wheezy (Debian 7.1) and would
prefer it if there was a pre-built dependency chain available through apt :)


Either way, when installing nm-dispatcher-olsrd from the 'oneiric'
branch, the only one with a Debian-compatible libc6 version dependency,
I get the following (pardon my sv_SE locale):

   St?ller in nm-dispatcher-olsrd (0.1-1~oneiric) ...
   Usage: /etc/init.d/network-manager
{start|stop|restart|force-reload|status}
   dpkg: fel vid hantering av nm-dispatcher-olsrd (--configure):
    underprocessen installerade post-installation-skript gav felkod 1

If you couldn't translate it, it means that that when apt runs configure
on nm-dispatcher-olsrd it gets a bad exit code (1). The ""Usage:"" line is
obviously from some attempt to run the network-manager init script.

If this is due to oneiric's network-manager not being the same as Debian
wheezy, nevermind this report. I haven't looked at what might really be
going on under the hood.


I'll make sure to try the mesh applet on an Ubuntu raring (13.04)
release as well, where I'm sure it'll install easier. However I've just
started to move away from Canonical since their Amazon trickstery (but
not all machines are migrated yet, so I'll make sure to make time!).

I just recently heard of it.  One of the people on the project, Yahel
Ben-David, was also involved in the AirJaldi mesh network in India.  The
rangzen software sounds like it would be very complimentary with OLSR mesh
networks.

Looks like quite an interesting project.  Its basically a secure system of
peer-to-peer delay-tolerant messaging.  On one hand, its good that they are
focusing on the layer above the actual network connectivity since it is an
area ripe for exploration.  It sounds like they are making delay-tolerant Tor,
with delay meaning hours, days, etc.

Their descriptions seem to say that this project
provide a complete networking solution when there is a network blackout.  But
when you look at the details of what the actual network is, they say it is
""leveraging whatever connectivity may be available, from full 3G/4G internet
access, through ad-hoc wifi & Bluetooth, to sneakernet (manual transport of
SD-cards).""

To use adhoc wifi, bluetooth, etc. seamlessly and transparently is quite
difficult and relies on lots of manual steps.  Sneakernet is definitely very
manual.  This means that this project will remain an ""activist tool"", and once
it is at all widely deployed, it will become a target like Tor is.  I suspect
Rangzen traffic will be tracked and blocked by China, etc. like how
Tor traffic is.

So the key its success of it is getting it working well with as many available
data transports as possible: mesh networks, GSM, internet, bluetooth, wifi
direct, sneakernet, etc.  Sounds like they have the money to do that.
Hopefully they'll work collaboratively and openly so that all of these related
projects can share on the hard technical details.

They have a paper which outlines their criticisms of existing approaches:

Hey all,

I've added Commotion MeshTether to the official Guardian build server, this is
a hardened build server that we use to make automatic, trusted test builds.
The box itself is not publicly online, but it posts its results here:

https://guardianproject.info/builds/CommotionMeshTether/

I recently did some work to get it closer to building straight from git.  It
will now automatically build whenever anyone pushes a commit, and if there is
a problem, it will email the email addresses found in the commits.

I just got it building, but I haven't tested it at all.  Feedback appreciated.
 I'd like to add MeshTether to F-Droid to get it out there.

Hey Will,

I'd be happy to advise on the process of setting up a Jenkins box, its not too
complicated.  I recommend running it on Debian/stable.  The first question to
ask about your Jenkins box is whether you want to use it for build feedback
and tests only, or whether you want to make trusted builds from it.  I would
not trust a public Jenkins to make release builds, period.  Its not secure
enough.  A public Jenkins might be OK to make public test builds, if its
closely watched.  We need our Jenkins to produce trusted test builds, so its
not publicly available.

We have heard about the possibility of having a private Jenkins instance sync
its info with a public Jenkins instance, so you can have the best of both
worlds.  We hope to try this out some day in the not too distant future.

That said, at this point running the MeshTether job is basically zero pressure
on our build server or me.  Once its setup, it mostly just runs.  I have found
that using build slaves to be the opposite though, they can be quite unstable.

I can try building a fresh copy of Commotion-OpenWRT this evening.

In the meantime, do please check your list of compiled packages.  My
working build tree just has the wpad package installed, not hostapd +
wpa_supplicant.  I do recall a some point recently the suggested config
file for building Commotion-OpenWRT switched over to wpad.  I do know that
having wpad AND hostapd / wpa_supplicant installed can cause weird
contention issues.

The photo suggests a TP-Link TL-MR3020 or TL-WN703N, indeed with an

Likewise, I'm about to deploy my 2nd TL-MR3020 as a repeater node for

It is neat to see a low-cost platform like the TL-MR3020, whose intended

I met Jason Griffey who is the developer of LibraryBox. One of his
features for the next version is ""mesh networking"". I'm wondering if the
work folks have done on ""appropriate box"" would be useful to share.

The solution I would pursue here is a custom openwrt kernel build that
includes the usb storage drivers, and is set to pull root from /dev/sda1.
 I believe this would be fairly simple to do -- just haven't got around to
doing it yet.

Sorry if this turns out to be an unnecessary question, but could someone
share an example working config for the olsrd_mdp plugin?  It seems my
local Commotion nodes are not using the plugin.

Here is olsrd_mdp plugin's home & README:

https://github.com/opentechinstitute/olsrd/tree/release-0.6.5.4/lib/mdp
https://github.com/opentechinstitute/olsrd/blob/release-0.6.5.4/lib/mdp/README_MDP

Likewise, these are the stanzas to add to /etc/olsrd.conf or
/etc/config/olsrd, respectively.  I'm curious how these stanzas look when
correctly populated.

LoadPlugin ""olsrd_mdp.so.0.1""
{
    PlParam     ""sid""   ""<Serval SID>""
    PlParam     ""servalpath""   ""<Serval Instance Path>""
}

config 'LoadPlugin'
    option 'library' 'olsrd_mdp.so.0.1'
    option 'sid' '<Serval SID>'
    option 'servalpath' '<Serval Instance Path>'

What is the current approach for creating and distributing a key to all

These will look very similar to what you have here. I do not have a node
running olsrd_mdp in front of me, but here are the class of things that
you can expect to enter there:

servalpath will be like /etc/serval (as it is by default on Commotion
nodes). This contains a place for the keys to be stored and the

1553,Commotion-dev, Setting masq & MTU values correctly with OLSRd,"Sat, 3 Aug 2013 19:38:38 -0500",-0500,Ben West,"Hi All,

I'm emailing here in follow-up to a recent thread on commotion-discuss
about repeater nodes not reliably having their internet-bound traffic
routed.

In particular, I was seeing my own repeater nodes, both 1-hop way and
especially 2-hops away, apparently losing their connection to the Internet
once the local OLSRd instance had inserted its tnl_* interface (i.e. a few
minutes after power up).  I'm highlighting the instance of a node 2-hops
away, since in practice that can be difficult to replicate.

Below is the readme about the SmartGateway feature.  Do please note in
particular the recommendation to add an iptables rules to the gateway node,
clamping all packets leaving the mesh to the same MTU as what is used by
the OLSRd SmartGateway tunnels.

http://svn.dd-wrt.com/browser/src/router/olsrd/README-Olsr-Extensions

This seemed to resonate with a sporadic problem I'd been having with
repeater nodes occasionally not seeing their Internet-bound traffic
correctly routed, despite all routing tables appearing valid.  These
repeater nodes restored their Internet connection when I enabled the
'mtu_fix' option on their local firewall.  But not consistently so, making
the problem very challenging to resolve.

So, following the advice from the readme, I added this to
/etc/firewall.user on my gateway node (eth0 is its wired uplink):

iptables -A FORWARD -o eth0 -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN -j TCPMSS
--set-mss 1480

On the gateway node with wired WAN and LAN ports, in addition to the mesh
interface, I set these firewall zones in /etc/config/firewall:

config zone
    option name 'mesh'
    option network 'mesh'
    option input 'ACCEPT'
    option output 'ACCEPT'
    option forward 'ACCEPT'
    option 'masq' '1'

config zone
    option name 'wan'
    option output 'ACCEPT'
    option masq '1'
    option input 'DROP'
    option forward 'ACCEPT'

config zone
    option input 'ACCEPT'
    option output 'ACCEPT'
    option forward 'ACCEPT'
    option name 'lan'
    option network 'lan'

config forwarding
    option src 'mesh'
    option dest 'wan'

config forwarding
    option src 'lan'
    option dest 'wan'

config 'forwarding'
    option 'src' 'mesh'
    option 'dest' 'mesh'

Next, on repeater nodes with only one LAN port (counter-intuitively labeled
'wan'), these are the firewall zones:

config 'zone'
    option 'name' 'mesh'
    option 'input' 'ACCEPT'
    option 'output' 'ACCEPT'
    option 'forward' 'ACCEPT'

config zone
    option name        wan
    option input    ACCEPT
    option output    ACCEPT
    option forward    ACCEPT
    option masq        1

config 'forwarding'
    option 'src' 'wan'
    option 'dest' 'mesh'

config 'forwarding'
        option 'src' 'mesh'
        option 'dest' 'mesh'

In particular, note how the 'masq' option is enabled on the zone 'mesh'
only for the gateway node, but not on the repeater nodes.  Likewise, 'masq'
is enabled on the zone corresponding to the local LAN port of the repeater
nodes, but not on the LAN port of the gateway node.  For Commotion-OpenWRT,
the firewall zones of the LAN ports would be equivalent to those of the APs
of each node.

This configuration described above appears to be what works for using the
SmartGateway feature with OLSRd v0.6.5.4-commotion-0.1-1.

I'm trying to review the firewall rules that commotiond is generating for
gateway and repeater nodes, to see if they follow.  However, I'm posting to
the listserv now in case someone else happens to see an oversight in how
Commotion-OpenWRT is deploying OLSRd and firewall config.

1. The OLSRd readme for SmartGateway specifically recommends clamping
MTU=1480 for all packets leaving the mesh on a gateway node, to align with
the MTU used by tunnels b/w nodes that SmartGateway creates.

2. Before adding the iptables rule for #1, I did see certain repeater nodes
lose Internet connectivity (aka pings to the outside fail) *immediately
after* their local OLSRd instance added the tnl_* tunnel to the gateway
node.

3. Likewise, trail and error with the 'mtu_fix' option on the firewalls of
gateway and repeater nodes did appear effective in restoring repeater
nodes' route to the outside, but not in any discernibly consistent
fashion.  mtu_fix = ""enable MSS clamping for *outgoing* zone traffic.""  So,
mtu_fix seems to imperfectly or incompletely perform the same function as
the iptables rule in #1.  I've since disabled mtu_fix on all mesh nodes
affected, to avoid throughput loss from any unnecessary MTU clamping.

4. Finally, the 'masq' option appears necessary for the mesh and WAN
firewall zones on the gateway node, and likewise for the AP/LAN zones on
repeater nodes.  It should not be enabled on the AP/LAN zones on the
gateway node, nor on the mesh zone for repeater nodes.  (This last item
could be in error.  Theoretically, one would expect masq to be required for
all zones.)

All of these details do suggest that a node needing to switch from gateway
to repeater role on-the-fly, i.e. when a wired uplink fails, will likely
need to reboot.

So I guess the lesson, which I should have known anyway, is that you

1570,Commotion-dev, Thoughts about more robust key management for,"Tue, 13 Aug 2013 14:36:22 -0500",-0500,Ben West,"Hi All,

This post is in follow-up to these recent PR's, and it is intended to be
brain-stormy, rather than direct advice for any particular implementation.

https://github.com/opentechinstitute/commotion-quick-start/pull/26
https://github.com/opentechinstitute/key-management-api/pull/1

While it is definitely good to have the QS UI encourage users to select an
adhoc password, the WPA encryption supports keys up to 63chars (or 64?) in
length.

For WasabiNet, I use the pwgen command line tool to generate strings with
lots of lot entropy specifically to reduce vulnerability to dictionary or
brute force attacks.  This vulnerability would be especially critical for
the adhoc net, as all nodes share than key.

What are thoughts about having Quickstart itself recommend adhoc/mesh keys
with optimal entropy?  I.e. perhaps have that field pre-filled with a
maximum entropy key that the user could copy/paste?  Maybe also have a
'regenerate' button next to the field to generate new keys as needed?

If you are already anticipating the case where a single individual (or
group of individuals working together) will flash and configure all nodes
in a single mesh, then they should be able to manage doing to the
copy-pasta to have all nodes set with the same 63char mesh key.

Please let us know your findings.

Where IPv4 use uni-directional tunnels (towards egress border router), with IPv6 we can do better. We can route to border router depending on source address. This is what IETF Homenet is working on.
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-troan-homenet-sadr-00

Recently, there is a kernel patch in ip6_subtrees, where SADR works well. Patch will be in 3.11. Backports to older stable versions would be next steps. #14 in:
https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=ddea368c78ff9acf45261a7c82635b98e9c1fcd6 

When using v6-smart-gateway using subtrees, all routers in the network MUST use SADR. We need more thoughts how to introduce this. 
How do we make sure all routers have SADR? 
Use a tunnel if a router in the path doesn't have SADR?
Make it mandatory for olsrv2?

Maybe experience a bit with what we have now (tunnels) and do it right in olsrv2 for (IPv4: tunnels, IPv6: SADR).

I'm checking back in on this thread to confirm the nightly build bot for
Commotion-OpenWRT is no longer running.  (Or never was?)

A gentleman asking me about problems he's been having using images dated
8/23/13 had me a bit confused, since the latest stable images are still
dated 5/24/13.  I think he had been trying to build his own firmware, hence
the recent date.

I'm hoping to get a Tidepools deployment going at some point soon here in

the mesh here (or, to be honest, a portal that is at minimum not

This instance of Tidepools would be used to test out various use cases for
the ""Sunflower"" solar-powered wifi mesh concept described on this video
below.  In particular, I have a 1GHz CPU / 512MB box where Tidepools would
live initially, with the eventual hope of transitioning to a small embedded
PC like a Cubieboard or a MK808, so that everything could run on solar
power.
http://gowasabi.net/content/announcing-sunflower-mesh

And also possibly we could take advantage of the St. Louis transit
authority maybe maybe maybe soon making realtime bus location data
available to 3rd party integrators.

I see this mobile instance of Tidepools mentioned on the website, with a
couple apps:
https://rhiwifi.co/

Likewise, the github repo looks to be very busy!  Excellent work, Jonathan!

If the Redhook Tidepools instance mentioned above is a bit out of date, are
there perhaps any other live instances of Tidepools showing how the mobile

Commotion-splash uses the commotion_helpers.lua module, which is
included in our luci-commotion package, hence the dependency. It's a
simple collection of helper functions, and it made sense to me at the
time to put it in our general LuCI package.

For your use, I would say get the commotion_helpers.lua file[1] and just
put it in /usr/lib/lua/, and that should solve your issue.

Since you're interested in using commotion-splash for your firmware, it
would be a good idea to package the Commotion helpers module as a
separate package, so people can use it (and thus commotion-splash)
without the rest of the Commotion dependencies and LuCI menus.

I'll work on that tomorrow and let you know.

cheers,
Dan

I just talked with our lead developer, and we are planning on pulling
out commotion_helpers into a separate OpenWRT package in the next few
weeks, so that you would be able to install Commotion-splash without any
unnecessary dependences. But for now, I would say just include the
commotion_helpers.lua file in /usr/lib/lua.

I've received an email from one of the organizers of a hackathon at
Ekoparty (http://ekoparty.org), a security conference taking place in
Buenos Airies in concert with the GNU 30th anniversary. Since we are
listed as a GNU 30 project, they were interested in possible
security-related tasks or bugs in Commotion that could conceivably be
tackled as part of a 3-day hackathon.

So I'd like to solicit suggestions for items that would be interesting
for participants to work on in connection with Commotion so that I can
forward that on to the organizers. The sooner we get some suggestions,
the more time participants will have to prepare. Thanks!

I just uploaded my package for python-networkmanager to the official Debian
'unstable' repo. It should be accepted within a week or two.  Then if there
are no problems with it, it will be automatically accepted into
Debian/testing.  Once in Debian/testing, it'll be automatically included in
Ubuntu.

nm-dispatcher-olsrd and commotion-mesh-applet both rely on
python-networkmanager.  They were both developed against a patched version
0.9.6.  All my fixes should be incorporated into 0.9.10, but I haven't tested
nm-dispatcher-olsrd or commotion-mesh-applet with 0.9.10.

1-  Copy the commotion_helpers.lua file from luci-commotion to /usr/lib/lua
2-  Apply the attached patch to commotion-splash.  (I hope this can be 
mainlined, I don't think it affects the workings of the actual commotion

3-  Manually copy the internet icon internet.128.png found in

I still have some issues keeping me from complete satisfaction: The 
""Allowed hosts/subnets"" field does not seem to work.  I don't know if 
it's a bug in commotion-splash, my own bug, or the fact that other 
commotion packages are absent.  I had to manually edit the

If there is no particular reason for sticking with a standalone version,
I recommend that we move to the one available through busybox. In the
busybox version, the '-e' flag is a compile-time option that is disabled
by default. So, just by switching to this version, we could close out

If that is not an option, disabling '-e' support in netcat will be more
difficult. Not impossible, just more difficult. Before I started on that

As the Commotion project has grown, we've added a large number of
different components and repositories, especially on the OpenWRT side.
In many cases, these were created and added in without any particular
conventions around repository naming, package naming, or package
classification. As I discovered when doing final release integration for
DR2, this has made our OpenWRT build-tree something of a confusing mess.
In the run-up to version 1 at the end of the year, and as part of our
continued migration of our project management to Github, I am currently
engaged in cleaning up and refactoring most of our OpenWRT-related
repositories. Some projects will be consolidated, others will be
renamed, and still others will be split. Unfortunately, there is no easy
way to do this without at least temporarily breaking builds; I will try
and finish up all the cleanup this afternoon/evening, so hopefully any
disruption should be relatively minor. I'll detail the complete cleanup
on the list and in a blog post once things are up and running again.
This should hopefully make building and contributing to the firmware
somewhat less confusing in the future. Thanks for your patience!

https://code.commotionwireless.net/projects/commotion/wiki/BigBoard

Offering comment on a high level, and after observing the ROBIN mesh
project splinter into closed-source forks and dead ends, supporting
interoperability with other mesh node dashboard and node database
implementations is a big plus, even if only partial.

The Interop group have recently documented various schemas for a node
databases here http://interop.wlan-si.net

By comparison, the CommonNodeDB repo from Aaron K (cited in the BigBoard
wiki page) is now a couple years old:
https://github.com/aaronkaplan/commonNodeDB

Additionally, WLAN Slovenia has their nodewatcher project, which appears to
be at or nearing substantial maturity:
https://dev.wlan-si.net/wiki/Nodewatcher
https://github.com/wlanslovenija/nodewatcher

Maybe there is something interesting in Nodewatcher that could be a good
fit for Commotion?

I think the wlan Slovenija guys are the leaders on this one, so it makes
sense to leverage their work and extend their work as required.  From
memory they also have some very capable developers who could probably do
much or all of the required work.

In fact, I wish we had a portal between them and our lab so that we could
make even more use of their skills.

Paul.

That page was the original brainstorming document for the dashboard we
kept. Development on the dashboard was then taken on by Nat, I don't
know where his documentation took place on the current dashboard. I do
know that we are using a variation of ffmap-d3
https://github.com/opentechinstitute/ffmap-d3 for our current dashboard
though.

All the above is very true. I think that whatever dashboard/database
Commotion moves forward with in the future, the nodes themselves should
be the ones runnign tests upon the network and sending that information
back to the dashboard.

To that vein whatever dashboard we choose to move forward with should
allow us to query into the network for further information or test
suites from specific nodes without the adminstrator having to ssh into
the node to run them.

These are just my personal opinions of course. :)

Another detail is what local agent must run on the nodes to collect
whatever data is to be sent the dashboard.  cron-based dashboard checkin
scripts are common; ROBIN mesh used this approach and I think WLAN
Slovenia's uses it now too.

Alternatively, OpenWRT does have packages for both a local zabbix agent and
also a shell-based munin agent (""muninlite"") on the node.

I was briefly looking into having muninlite to run locally on WasabiNet
nodes and talk to a munin server in the Cloud. However, I ultimately veered
away from this tool, as it requires xinetd to run continuously (chewing up
~1Mbyte of RAM).

1633,Commotion-dev, Serval memory leaks,"Thu, 31 Oct 2013 18:04:58 -0400",-0400,Dan Staples,"At the international summit for community wireless networks last month,
we noticed on the Commotion network we set up that the Serval daemon,
and one of our own programs which uses the Serval library, were using up
an awful lot of memory and leading to OOM conditions in which the
routers rebooted periodically.

I noticed today, as I've been debugging our code that uses the Serval
library, that Valgrind reports quite a bit of leaked memory from a
single call to both keyring_open and keyring_enter_pin. 527,056 bytes
lost memory to be exact, stemming from malloc and calloc calls in those
functions. Perhaps this is our problem?

This was seen with both 0.90 and 0.91. I can send Valgrind output if
that would be helpful.

It got rid of the 500kb leak, but there's still some unfreed allocated

1637,Commotion-dev, [Commotion-discuss] Memory Issues and Nightly,"Wed, 06 Nov 2013 09:54:54 -0500",-0500,Dan Staples,"+commotion-dev

If your nodes are crashing w/ 15-20 clients, while both serval and
commotion-splash are disabled, that is very worrisome!

I propose to the Commotion dev team that we urgently need to come up
with a way to simulate network load, so we can identify and fix the
causes of these types of crashes. Does anyone have ideas or experiences
with this? Perhaps we can take the technical discussion over to the
commotion-dev list only.

And just an update for you Dan, earlier this week I found and fixed a
significant memory leak in Serval...not sure how much that will affect
the instability we've seen, but we'll soon know with some testing. The
fix will make its way into the nightly builds probably by the end of the
week.

As long as the rest of your network is DR1 or newer, the nightly builds
should be compatible.

1638,Commotion-dev, [Commotion-discuss] Memory Issues and Nightly,"Wed, 6 Nov 2013 09:37:46 -0600",-0600,Ben West,"I am also seeing sporadic memory consumption issues operating mesh nodes
running AA r38347 in WasabiNet on Nanostation Loco M2.

That is, using the same ath9k wifi driver and same underlying OS, but
without the Commotion-specific tools like commotiond and servald.  I will
see nodes boot up with ~26Mbytes memory usage and then gradually increase
over the next few days until sporadic nodes start crashing with page
allocation failures (aka memory exhausted).  This all is happening despite
having 3Mbytes of compressed swap space allocated.    When I am able to log
into crashed nodes to inspect, I will occasionally find the current memory
usage to be *less* than the average observed on bootup, along with
~500Kbytes sitting in swap.

This seems to suggest something is very sporadically allocating itself a
large chunk (multiple MBytes), but not residing in memory as such, and
causing other processes to crash in consequence.  I do use the coovachilli
captive portal in WasabiNet, which could be a culprit and thus unrelated to
Commotion, but there could also be an underlying memory leak in the kernel
or wifi driver.

What are thoughts for having crashed nodes try to collect a debug report
about themselves when a crash condition is detected (e.g. no Internet
access, ""page allocation failure"" detected in syslog), and then write that
report to flash somewhere before the node get rebooted by its frustrated
user?

Besides that, do note that nodes with only 32MBytes of RAM, like UBNT
Picostations, are going to have difficulties hosting local apps for many
users.  If Dan Hasting would be able to use an alternate device with
64Mbytes+ RAM, e.g. a UBNT Rocket, Unifi, or even an indoor TP-Link router
(all of which should be able to run Commotion-OpenWRT), that may be a
viable workaround in cause chasing down memory leaks becomes too ornery.

Thanks for offering more detail, especially that you see the nodes
spontaneously reboot rather than simple have services crash.

I would again point out that the Picostations will have a finite limit for
simultaneous clients.  15 to 20 clients is quite a few, each client
requiring a portion of available of RAM.  It may be a single Picostation is
not going to be able to sustain all of them.

Dan, can you provide any more detailed info on exactly what was
happening when you see the node crashing? How many simultaneous users,
and what were they doing (viewing a webpage on the internet, or viewing
the node's administrative web interface, etc)?

are normally intended for use as thin hotspots in high-usage environments,
i.e. DHCP and NAT routing not done on the device itself.  So,
Commotion-OpenWRT issuing DHCP leases and performing NAT one or 2 local
LANs onboard does consume memory that otherwise would go to serving 802.11n
clients.  This is an inherent limitation of the chosen architecture.

Besides that, I would assume at least these processes need to devote a
portion of available RAM to each client on the public AP in
Commotion-OpenWRT:

   - /proc/net/nf_conntrack entries
   - nodogsplash (although possibly only on initial portal page viewing)
   - uhttpd (again, only on portal page viewing)
   - the ath9k driver itself

If memory serves, I saw the same problem with the USRP device not being

Glad to hear the udev rule fixed that issue!

As for the openbtscli problem, I would suggest looking at the OpenBTS
documentation. It's certainly possible that the scripts included in the
live distro don't properly start OpenBTS if the device installation
didn't go as expected. For reference you can check our installation
script[1], and the script we use to start OpenBTS and the other services[2].

Sorry I can't be more helpful, it's been a while since I've played with
the live image...

Thanks to the fact that we were running a serial console that was

Overall, it looks like the node simply runs out of memory. The first
errors are when malloc()s in servald fail Then, when things get really
bad, there are errors from the wireless driver saying that it cannot
allocate buffer space.

Obviously the failures from the wireless driver are bad. They are
probably ultimately what causes the node to reboot.

I wonder, though, about the servald malloc() failures. I'm not sure if
they are pure symptom (i.e, servald just happens to be the application
most commonly allocating memory space when the crash happens and so its
malloc()s fail first), or if it is part of the problem (i.e, servald

exhaustion, and I should point out on a node *not* running serval or
commotiond.  (I.e. since this isn't Commotion-OpenWRT firmware I'm writing
about, but very similar.)  The relevant dmesg I've sent to the
OpenWRT-devel list, which you can read here:

https://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/openwrt-devel/2013-November/022398.html
https://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/openwrt-devel/2013-November/022399.html

If particular interest is that, since the node didn't spontaneously reboot
or become inaccessible, I SSH'ed in and found a 240Kbyte dump file that
wpa_supplicant had written to /tmp , with about the same timestamp as when
memory errors began appearing in syslog.  Possibly this points to
wpa_supplicant itself as source of intermittent memory leaks?  I'm using
the wpad package, and I haven't yet had a chance to try out the version of
wpad-mini modified to include IBSS-RSN support.  I would be curious if
switching to wpad-mini has any effect on the memory errors you're seeing,
Will.

Besides that, do please note that I run the coovachilli captive portal,
instead of NDS, and coova is definitely a memory hog of questionable
stability.  That is, coova may end up being my problem, making this
unrelated to Commotion.

Finally, check out these recommended kernel tweaks from OpenWRT-devel for
having the node just spontaneously reboot upon OOM error or kernel oops.
Naturally, these wouldn't fix the memory problem itself, but good to know
for reference.

"" for routers in production i prefer setting
/proc/sys/vm/panic_on_oom = 2
/proc/sys/kernel/panic = 10

also if you like
/proc/sys/kernel/panic_on_oops = 1 ""

Have you tried it with the recent servald update that fixed a few memory
leaks?

As for high load generating malloc() activity in servald, it would need to
be activity that touches servald in some way (obvious and direct or
otherwise).  It will also be interesting to know if it is in servald or
libserval being used by another application.  Are you able to repeat the
test with servald not running, and see whether it still happens?

Paul,

Thanks for the response. I am planning on rerunning these tests tomorrow and had already planned on doing the tests that you suggest. I think that your suggestions will help us get to the bottom of what we are seeing here.

That said, it is my *hunch* that this crash has very little to do with any particular application. I think that it is more the result of the device simply running out of memory and having very little recourse but to restart.

I will post here with additional results. Thanks again for your response.

This is very interesting. And relevant. We've actually got some code waiting to be merged that will move us to wpad-mini. I will try to build an image with that code and see if I can make the node panic in the same way. Thanks for the suggestion!

Are you able to send along that dump file? Your second message to the lists says that you retained it, but I want to see just how good your archive system is :-)

Thanks for sending this along. We actually disabled several of these things (like reboot automatically on panic) so that we could attempt to debug the problem when it happened. It turned out that the most efficient way to get a dump like this was to have the node hooked to a console. 

The settings that you are using seem like the way to go for production nodes. I think that's what you're suggesting, right? With those settings, when the node starts to have trouble and eventually falls over, it will automatically restart without any user intervention. 

Again, thanks for the detailed response. I look forward to figuring this out together!

We haven't yet tested (or merged) the memory leak fix, but we'll be sure
to report any difference that makes.

The only program we have that uses libservald is the serval-crypto
program we wrote for app advertising. We definitely saw serval-crypto's
uses of libservald lead to low memory conditions and crashes at the
Wireless Summit, so that's a good suggestion. Will, were there any apps
on the mesh when you saw the node crash?

I'm beginning the process of writing the serval plugin for commotiond
that will allow us to only package libservald and not the daemon, which
will at least save disk space, and hopefully less memory use as well.

It doesn?t shape traffic, it manages packet dispatcher in case of queuing.
The problem might be that WLAN drivers have their own large fifo queue, so CoDel can?t manage packet dispatcher. Better integration of AQM at OS level and interface driver FIFO transmission queue is needed.

It has less to do with sgwdynspeed. That one is for selecting the border router based on larger up/down rate and lower ETX.

Agreed. As I remember it, it involves cloning the build repo,
adding/editing a file, and submitting a pull request. The hardest part
is setting up a gitorious account; which is as hard as you'd expect such

Building a Mesh Network in Rural Somaliland
Published:  December 11, 2013

by Daniel Hastings

I had heard about mesh networking before I arrived in Somaliland, but
had never been in the position to actually build a mesh network. When I
accepted the position as ICT instructor at Abaarso School of Science and
Technology in Abaarso, Somaliland, I figured this may be my chance. I
knew that the Open Technology Institute (OTI) had been developing a mesh
firmware called Commotion, suitable for remote locations. Upon arriving
in Somaliland I decided that building a mesh network using Commotion
would be one of my top priorities.

It seemed like building a mesh network could be a difficult process. I
experimented in the past with other firmware on a variety of routers,
but found the configuration to be too time-consuming and difficult to
set up.
I knew Commotion ran on Ubiquti hardware, designed for rough outdoor
environments like Somaliland. Unfortunately, finding Ubiquti routers in
Somaliland -- for that matter, getting anything into Somaliland -- is no
easy task.

Somaliland is an independent autonomous region of Somalia, and is an
area that is safe compared to the southern regions of Somalia. While not
internationally recognized as a country, Somaliland has its own
currency, government, and military.

The analogy I like to use when it comes to traveling to Somaliland is no
different than that of getting to Hogwarts. Instead of running head
first into an imaginary platform at the train station, you have to land
in Dubai, catch a flight that leaves only once a week and then travel
across a desert on one of the worst-built roads you can imagine.

While back in the US this past summer I contacted OTI and found that
they would be able to provide me with the proper equipment to run and
set up a mesh network using Commotion. I was so excited about the
possibility of actually getting all of the equipment into Somaliland
that I carefully packed everything into my carry-on.

Before I go any further, I should explain my level of experience with
building networks. My only experience with networking had been taking a
class at a community college in San Francisco and spending the last year
troubleshooting our Internet problems at school. However, Commotion is
built in such a way that little if any advanced configuration is
necessary to set up a mesh network.

I first began building my network by identifying where I wanted access
points on campus and mapping out distances between each spot. Having a
good line of sight between each node was extremely important. Luckily we
have a lot of high guard and water towers on campus so placing nodes was
not an issue.

One minor problem with placing nodes in towers was that I had to ensure
a reliable power source was within range of the node. If all my nodes
were solar-powered, I would not have had to worry about running any
cable at all!

I next had to ?flash? each router, which means loading the Commotion
firmware on to each Ubiquti device. I had experience flashing firmware
onto routers before but had never ?meshed? wireless nodes together. To
help with this I referred to the configuration examples on Commotion?s
website, which I found extremely helpful. Open source software has been
known to be tricky to configure and maintain but it certainly does not
have to be. Commotion has proved this to be more than true.

While building the network, I made sure to include students as much as I
could. I assembled together a computer club of my top ICT students to
discuss and teach the basics of mesh networking, how to flash firmware
onto routers, and how to add a node to the network. Together we ran
cable and climbed water towers to place the nodes in their proper
places. We also had to place some nodes in the guard towers which often
times, the guards would unplug accidentally. Students trained the guards
on the difference between the LAN and PoE ports as well as the
importance of keeping the PoE cable plugged in at all times. A few weeks
after school we put up the last two nodes for the girls? dorms and the
boys? dorms.

Local Applications and Limited Bandwidth

Somaliland is currently the only country in Africa that lacks fiber
optic access -- cables are laid but access is not predicted to be
available until 2014. Somaliland receives its Internet connection via
microwaves across the desert from Djibouti. All of the IP address ranges
in Somaliland will tell you that you are in Djibouti. The distant
gateway connectivity, not to mention unreliable ISPs, equates to some
seriously slow Internet.

A lack of consistent access to the Internet is an ICT instructor?s
nightmare. Not being able to teach the most current technologies can be
frustrating, and it also hampers sharing files with students.
Mesh networking is described as a ?peer to peer network:? I wanted to
use the full sense of the term and make file sharing among my students
easy and manageable. In order to solve this communication problem I
decided to rely less on the outside Internet and rely more on local
applications installed on our servers.

I found the solution to our inconsistent and slow Internet by installing
OwnCloud, an open source alternative to Dropbox, on our local server.
Now students could share homework assignments with me and other teachers
without having to rely on the Internet at all.

Creating a Self-Sufficient Network

As well as the network worked and as much fun as setting it up was, I
cannot call this project successful until I can come back to Somaliland
a year from now and see the same nodes in place running the same network.
I used a few methods to make sure this would be the case. I was careful
to document every aspect of the project and create detailed guides for
teachers and future network administrators on everything from how to
find your IP address on the network to how to ping a node, which is
important for isolating a potential problem on the network. Even though
mesh networks are ?self-healing?, they are not perfect and still have
their quirks.

Having all of the knowledge centered in one place with one staff member
will only set an organization up for failure, so I've made sure to give
a series of small trainings to the entire staff.

The more transparent you are about how the network works, the more
likely the technology will last.

I repeatedly told my students that some of the greatest makers and
technologists of our time were self-taught. The excellent support
community centered around open source software makes projects such as
Commotion sustainable. There is a good chance that if a problem arises,
someone else already had that issue or someone in another community
across the globe is working on a solution to that problem.

I would like to give my sincere gratitude to the Commotion Wireless
Project for the support they gave me along with providing me with
necessary tools to build this network. Not only did the students at
Abaarso School get extremely enthused about mesh networking and learn
the meaning of community technology, but now another small part of a
country that, technically, does not even exist is more connected to the
rest of the world.

1672,Commotion-dev, mesh workshop in NYC,"Thu, 12 Dec 2013 09:28:33 -0500",-0500,Hans-Christoph Steiner,"
This would be a different workshop than a community mesh workshop.  The idea
is to entirely focus on the adhoc side of it, so the desktop and mobile
clients, and applications that work on mesh alone (IMing, voip calling, our
p2p app/file sharing, etc).  We want to get the participants all set up with
the adhoc tools as as quickly as possible, so we'd have a basic pre-prepared
mesh at the workshop location.

So far its Diana and me on the planning of the workshop.  We're still working
on the length and exact format.  If it ends up being longer format, then I
think it could make sense to have a part that covers working with the wifi
routers, like the Tunisia materials.

Adding Willow, because I think this aligns with some projects that GWOB is
working on as well, and I don't think she's on this list!

I'm also interested in helping with the planning. We just held a workshop
in Detroit to introduce the idea of local applications, and our next focus
round would be more focused on applications that leverage the capabilities
of the mesh. I also think that there would be interest from the organizing
teams in Red Hook and Hoboken, as they are both thinking about applications
for their networks, although with different contexts.

I know that people from the Commotion team will also be at the OpenITP
hackathon in January in DC (
https://www.openitp.org/blog/dc-hackathon-for-security-privacy-tools-on-jan-11-2014.html).
It might be interesting to work on some of these ideas there as well. Is
anyone on the list thinking about coming to that hackathon?

More details: we chatted with Erica of Eyebeam and came up with a loose plan.
Let us know how this works for y'all, its not etched in stone yet.

* a full day workshop on Saturday April 5th at Eyebeam.  10-5pm.
* 10-1pm bring in laptops and phones and mesh them!
* complete an assignment using the ad-hoc mesh, something like a journalism
assignment desk when the dark overlords have shutdown the internet and are
arresting anyone trying to use it.
* 1-2pm lunch
* 2-5pm The Day After: now we need an internet replacement, let's learn how to
build out the citywide mesh. People buy router hardware in advance, and learn
how to configure it with Commotion, then build a mini-city-wide mesh around
Eyebeam.  If you haven't been there, its a big open warehouse with tall
ceilings, so people will be able to stick mesh nodes all over.

I think it would make sense if Guardian lead up the first half with OTI
helping, then the next half would be OTI leading with Guardian helping.

About the IP addresses, we have changed our IP addressing schema for the
latest release. We are no longer using
5.x.x.x/101.x.x.x/102.x.x.x/103.x.x.x subnets. Instead, we are using the
100.64.0.0/10 address space for the mesh network, and 10.0.0.0/8 for the
all client networks. I am hoping we'll put out a longer statement soon
about the reasoning behind this decision and what it will mean in terms
of compatibility.

First, you should start using the github.com source repos instead of
git.chambana.net as all of our development commits is happening there.

Pointing you to commotion-feed git was my mistake.  If you clone
https://github.com/opentechinstitute/commotion-router.git then run
setup.sh, it will bring in the openwrt build tree and add the commotion
specific feeds, you will be ready to build commotion-router.

See this part of the readme for more info:
https://github.com/opentechinstitute/commotion-router#installation

Let me know if you have more questions.

1690,Commotion-dev, [Commotion-discuss] Brick or Nanostation?,"Fri, 10 Jan 2014 14:29:02 -0600",-0600,Ben West,"(Replying only on Commotion-dev listserv ...)

Triggering TFTP mode via the POE injector can be tricky, and is sometime
unreliable.  I'd recommend trying a different POE injector, if you have one
spare.  I've had the little reset button on older injectors just stop
working after some time.  Also, I believe only the UBNT 1Amp POE injectors
now have the reset button, not the stock injector provided with the
Nanostation.

Also, try holding down the reset button for longer, say 15 to 20 seconds.

Finally, if you are still not able to get the device into TFTP mode, you
can fashion your own reset switch by slicing cat5.  I believe the forum at
community.ubnt.com will have more info about that.

1691,Commotion-dev, Commotion R1 Changes,"Fri, 10 Jan 2014 17:52:38 -0500",-0500,Dan Staples,"Developers and network maintainers might want to check out our blog post
on significant backwards-imcompatible changes in the R1 release:
https://commotionwireless.net/blog/commotion-r1-breaking-changes

In summary:
* Mesh IP addresses are now self-assigned in the 100.64.0.0/10 range and
all client subnets are bridged and assigned addresses in the 10.0.0.0/8
range
* default adhoc SSID and channel were removed
* adhoc BSSID is now deterministically generated based on hash of SSID
and channel

The blog post explains the details and reasoning behind these changes,
for those that are interested, and also includes info on upgrading
pre-R1 Commotion networks.

You can also find R1 release notes here:

1692,Commotion-dev, Alternate mac80211 / hostapd from nbd for ath9k,"Tue, 14 Jan 2014 15:05:58 -0600",-0600,Ben West,"Howdy,

Giving you a heads up about a problem I've encountered on UBNT Nanostation
Loco M2, Nanostation M5, and TP-Link TL-MR3020.  WLAN Slovenija also saw it
on other TP-Link products.  Good chance Commotion-OpenWRT might be seeing
this driver freeze, too.

Under heavy load conditions, the ath9k driver bundled with recent versions
of AA may freeze, and all broadcast SSIDs disappear.  For me, this was also
causing additional weird side-effects like hostapd/wpa_supplicant crashing,
and olsrd complaining "" OLSR: sendto IPv4 Resource temporarily
unavailable,"" depending on which vif happened to lock up.

The lockup does appear to correlate well with heavy traffic load, i.e.
never see this problem on nodes with very light traffic.  Also, it's very
intermittent.  Nodes with a weekly reboot schedule might see this lockup a
couple times a month or so, in my experience.

This is the ticket filed in OpenWRT issue queue:
https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/13681

This is the updated version of mac80211 and hostapd which nbd has offered
to address the driver lockup issue under AA.  I've reflashed my affected
problem nodes over the past couple weeks (AA r39154), and so far so good.
I presume these versions will eventually be backported into AA.
http://nbd.name/gitweb.cgi?p=aa-mac80211.git;a=summary

Finally, this is the script from WLAN Slovenija to detect the freeze and
trigger a reboot.  I've incorporated this script as-is in WasabiNet
firmware for Nanostation Loco M2s and the TL-MR3020s.
https://github.com/wlanslovenija/firmware-packages-opkg/blob/master/util/nodewatcher-watchdog/files/check_ath9k_freeze

For Nanostation M5s, the string the check for is ""qdepth: 0 ampdu-depth: 0
pending: 124 stopped: 1"".

1693,Commotion-dev, Adding babeld and ipv6 support to Commotion,"Tue, 14 Jan 2014 20:59:33 -0500",-0500,Genevieve Bastien,"Hello Commotion Developers,

We have an eye on the Commotion firmware here at R?seau Libre Montreal. 
It's still missing a few things before we can adopt it:

* babeld support (and more generally possibility to select routing protocol)
* ipv6 support (ipv6 itself and their configuration by Commotion)

There's a team of 4th year computer engineering students who will do 
their final project on this topic. They are cc'ed to this email. The 
project started with the broad scope of ""Adapting the Commotion firmware 
to R?seau Libre's needs and fancies ;-)"". For now, those are 2 items we 
identified that we'd really like to have to accelerate our adoption. As 
the semester advances, some other elements of contribution may pop up. 
I'll be supervising them locally but they'll get the most benefit from 
interacting with the whole community.

I heard from Grady that babeld and ipv6 support were in your roadmap. 
Has any work or thinking been done on it yet? Any tips and advice for 
the team?

Thanks,
Genevi?ve

Question: is the decision to address all clients within the address space
10.0.0.0/8 to, among other things, help make client roaming between nodes
easier?  I.e. implying that clients would be assigned the same IP
regardless of which node they associate with?

If you find node which seems to have one of its vif's locked up like this,
but still have access to a local SSH/serial console, this command could
tell if you if the driver is indeed stuck:

Thanks!

think even the batman-adv routing in Cloudtrax nodes use may also do this

factors like ...

bounced back to the splash page, regardless of how many nodes he has roamed

1700,Commotion-dev, Adding babeld and ipv6 support to Commotion,"Thu, 16 Jan 2014 14:08:42 -0500",-0500,Josh King,"Hi Genevieve,

That's really great that you and your team are interested! We've
definitely done a lot of thinking about how to implement this. Let me
split this up into babeld and IPv6, and outline some of the moving pieces:

Babeld:
There are four main components to how we currently interact with OLSRd,
and these would presumably need to be adapted to work with either Babel
or OLSRd.
* commotiond provides a mechanism for access to and manipulation of
profiles, which are intended to describe the configuration of a network.
Presumably, we would need to add a field to the profiles that would
designate which routing daemon we're using. This is pretty trivial, and
I should have time to do this within the next week or two.
* luci-commotion, or more specifically the setup wizard, provides the
web interface for people to configure their devices. This would need to
be adapted to provide options for selecting a routing mechanism for the
network. This should also be pretty easy, and I'll talk to our LuCI
developers about where this would make sense on our roadmap.
* The actual configuration of OLSRd is mostly handled by a hotplug
script, which is run whenever a network interface is brought up or down.
It automatically changes OLSRd's configuration file for anything that
might change based on options entered by the user in the setup wizard.
For OLSRd, that is specifying Interfaces, HNAs, and some of the
configuration for our own plugins. We are not super familiar with Babel,
so this could be a good entry point for someone to work on getting Babel
working with Commotion.
* The last element is duplicating the functionality for which we have
written custom OLSRd plugins on babeld. We've written the olsr-mdp
plugin, which signs routing traffic using a serval key supplied by
commotiond, and the olsr-dnssd plugin that propagates multicast DNS
traffic in an OLSR mesh. This is definitely the most difficult, but is
also not necessarily a prerequisite for most operation (we could simply
say that those features are not supported yet in conjunction with babel).

IPv6:
Fortunately since we moved up to a newer version of OpenWRT Attitude
Adjustment for version 1.0, it is now much easier to add native IPv6
support to the underlying OS. One just has to add the ipv6-support
package to OpenWRT (which I almost did before the v1 release, but held
off in order to make sure that we weren't introducing other problems).
However, some components would need to be updated to properly utilize this.
* commotiond, as above, would need to be updated with the appropriate
configuration fields. This is pretty simple.
* luci-commotion, as above, would need to provide configuration options
for IPv6.
* The OLSRd hotplug script would need to be updated to deal with IPv6
options. Notably, OLSRd can't handle running both an IPv4 and IPv6 stack
at the same time, so we'd need to come up with some way of handling this
for nodes that have more than one mesh interface. We also may need to
figure out how to support NIIT, which OLSRd uses in order to tunnel IPv4
client traffic over an IPv6 backbone.

So, that's a high-level summary of what it seems like it would take. A
lot of these components are relatively easy to tackle, and are mostly a
matter of experimentation. Since we're not as familiar with babeld,
we're looking forward to working with you all on getting this
implemented in Commotion.

When I was doing some brief research on wifi handover a while ago, it
seemed the most common way of doing it used some 802.11 extensions
(don't remember the letters), and a central RADIUS server for
coordinating clients and handoffs between APs. So that seems like a way
to do it.

Another alternative I was looking at is called SMesh
(http://www.smesh.org/). It also does coordination of client handover,
but using a multicast group instead of a central coordinating node. The
details are here:
http://www.cnds.jhu.edu/pub/papers/smesh_tocs_accepted_version.pdf. I
think it would be worth experimenting with this.

Although I have been told that Batman-Adv does seamless client handover
due to it being a layer 2 mesh routing protocol. Haven't tried that
myself though.

A RADIUS server would indeed help play the role of coordinating clients
across all APs/hotspots in a mesh.  It does add a fair bit of complexity,
along with a central point of control that a bit adverse to meshing
topology.  I looking more at simple distributed methods to assist client
roaming (e.g. sharing lists of client MACs/ lease IPs between nodes).  For
a particular client connected to a particular node, it's probably safe to
assume that only that node's immediate neighbors need to know about that
client's potential to roam.

Since the decision about whether to roam is made entirely by the client,
just having several nodes/APs broadcast the same SSID, even across
different channels, should be enough for many clients to roam.  This mode
of operation (i.e. all nodes broadcast the same SSID for their public AP),
was explicitly encouraged with the old ROBIN firmware, although it was
acknowledged that some clients might not be intelligent enough to
automatically refresh their DHCP lease upon association with the new node.
Having clients issued a unique IP in their DHCP lease regardless of node
would at least remove that problem.

Also, the UniFi java-based controller pulls off client roaming, without
needing a central authentication arbiter like a RADIUS server, by depending
on a central DHCP server and also by having APs broadcast the same SSID.
However, since the UniFi firmware is closed source, it could also be using
some fancy 802.11 extensions to assist roaming.

The SMesh project looks like it wants to take seamless roaming a step
further.  I.e. in addition to the layer 2 / layer 3 handoff we're
discussing, also preserve a client's open connections.  Cool!

I'm not following, how would unique client IP addresses remove the
problem? The way SMesh does handoff is by setting a 2sec DHCP lease
time, thus causing the client to renew constantly to the nearest AP. The
nice thing is that doesn't require any changes on the client
side...clever, in my opinion :)

Sorry didn't see the detail about a 2sec DHCP lease in the SMesh paper,
just the language about preserving open connections across roaming!
(Didn't read far enough...)

 IMO, such a short DHCP lease would help smooth roaming, but I'm curious
about the extent of overhead it creates.  That would have dnsmasq (or
equivalent) working continuously on the node, using resident memory to do
so.  Likewise, it would send out a fair amount of traffic over the channel
just to manage the DHCP leases.  This may not work well on
low-quality/noisy connections, e.g. ~1Mbit/s transfer rates, with all the
DHCP overhead displacing client traffic.

We support the Nexus 7 running CM nightlies w/o requiring root on the device. The support for this is in our CM branch. Builds of that are available at http://downloads.commotionwireless.net/android/. You can also build from source at https://github.com/opentechinstitute/commotion-android using the cm branch.

Documentation for that release is still thin and there are several caveats (most importantly, IBSS-RSN is not supported and requires olsrd to run on a non-standard, non-privileged port [5001]).

Please let me know what issues you find!

lightweight WasabiNet nodes, albeit not yet with any additional firmware
loaded via USB port.  Just been squeezing everything into 4MBytes.

I believe opkg errors you're seeing are from the commotiond packages, etc,
not being from the same compile run as the stock AA images you're initially
flashing onto the device.  It should work if you flash the device with a
pared-down AA image from the same compile run as commotiond.

I'm attaching the .config I've used for compiling WasabiNet firmware (based
on AA r39154) for TL-MR3020.  This produces an image just about 300kbytes
smaller than the 4MB flash (done partly via the ""-funit-at-a-time"" compile
optimization), although it excludes luci and any USB support.  This config
also depends on modded versions of libcyassl and libcurl, to permit curl to
operate with the smaller libcyassl library instead of libopenssl.

Since Commotion-OpenWRT doesn't use it, you should be fine to disable
libcurl/curl and then re-enable USB support at whatnot, along with whatever
other pruning is needed to get the image to fit in 4Mbytes.

A couple details I can share about experience with the little TP-Link
units, after having them in regular use for several months now:

1. The popular instructions linked to on the OpenWRT wiki for adding an
external antenna seem to leave the devices badly susceptible to ESD
damage.  I've seen 2 MR3020's mysteriously lose much of their TX power
after lightning storms passed over (even though the units were inside).
This tutorial from a very diligent Australian appears to get it right, by
attaching the antenna pigtail so as not to bypass filter / matching
circuits that could protect the radio chip from surges.  I'm awaiting the
next strong thunderstorm to see if this has any improvement in ESD
protection.
https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=46543
https://app.box.com/s/cispknq8b9zgog8k5vxn

2. In lieu of external antenna mods possibly not being viable for MR3020 or
WR703N due to ESD vulnerability, I'm hoping to soon check out the TL-MR3220
and/or TL-MR3420.  These units have similar specs, 32MBytes RAM, 4MByte
flash, USB, but they also include stock external antennas *and* LAN ports.
Amazon sells the MR3220 for $30, and Musti claims it could be had cheaper
elsewhere.

We do not have a pre-baked build that has olsrd running on the default port. It's definitely not hard to make, though. Would that help with the upcoming NYC mesh workshop?

You are absolutely correct about the assumption that CM installation goes hand-in-hand with having a rooted device. However, we are building it with the expectation that this version of the Commotion app will run on non-rooted, non-CM devices when AOSP adopts the CM ad-hoc patches, etc. So, while currently we are making a distinction where there is no difference, we think that in the future we are going to be positioned for SUCCESS :-)

Does that make sense?

I have always felt that the CM support/compatibility for Commotion has been underplayed. With 10M+ devices out there (supposedly), the ability to run on older devices, and the new/easier CM install process, it seems like there is a much greater potential overlap, at least in the next 12 months, with potential Commotion mesh communities.

The AOSP goal is fantastic and it is exciting it is a reality within reach but it will take a while for that to reach the market.

When I read it, I was thinking, ""hey that sounds kind of like...oh. Ok,
it's mesh.""

Proprietary issues aside, it's interesting. Of course, sharing internet
bandwidth is nothing new with mesh networks; any OLSRd-based network
like Commotion provides internet bandwidth sharing from multiple gateways.

What I'm still curious about is *how* BeWifi pools or distributes that
bandwidth. Unless there is some sort of network coding/multipath TCP
functionality (which would require similar capabilities at the
destination), it is presumably just doing optimized gateway selection to
route a user's traffic to the internet. OLSRd's Smart Gateway plugin
does this, sort of, but without bandwidth measurements AFAIK. Although I
hear OLSRd v2 can do this even better.

Also interesting that it's being piloted in Catalonia...I wonder how
Guifi.net feels about it ;)

1723,Commotion-dev,,"Sun, 26 Jan 2014 12:05:51 -0600",-0600,Ben West,"Quoting details about the actual hardware being built:

""The way Telefonica has made this happen in a practical way is to build its
own routers that can be installed in houses within a neighborhood. So far
these have had to be installed by engineers, but the next generation are
plug-and-play, and eventually all that will be needed is an over-the-air
software update to customers' existing routers. According to Rodriguez, the
software 'creates a mesh to aggregate the capabilities [of the routers].'
Pooling all of the bandwidth from these routers allows anyone within the
network to take advantage of it at home, and they can also connect to any
BeWifi network they come across on their mobile devices when out and about.""

It could very well be the Telefonica routers would do some sort intelligent
repeating or meshing wirelessly, although I'm guessing much of the
bandwidth optimization may be accomplished by ensuring adjacent access
points do not overlap channels or broadcast with excessive TX power.  (This
is because I'm assuming Telefonica provides its broadband service nominally
via conventional wireline, e.g. DSL or cable, and actual wireless backhaul
in such a scheme would be used seldom.)

My question: would Telefonica subscribers then be *required* to use the
router provided, with its stock firmware, per revised ToS?  And likewise
they would be given very limited admin permissions on that device (e.g.
change the SSID and WPA key, but little else)?  I can understand the need
to compel subscribers as such to ensure uniform bandwidth management, but
it still seems like this walks in opposite directions of what community
mesh advocates are seeking.

Cupcake. Cryptocat posted an interesting debrief from it[1], in which
they made some interesting observations regarding the crypto-related
aspects of the user experience:

""""""
The area of the most confusion ? to the point where it made the users
feel threatened or panicked ? was the user information screens (either
for a specific buddy or the user themselves). Though ?fingerprint? is
widely known by cryptography and security experts, it is, at the end of
the day, jargon. There were several participants who immediately
associated ?fingerprint? with a negative connotation (i.e., leaving a
fingerprint at a crime scene). Their tone was panicked in asking their
questions on this issue, and were unsure of why that information needed
to be displayed, and if it was even safe to display. There were a
handful of users who understood encryption technology at a very basic
level who were not confused by the terminology on this page, but were
unsure of what to do with this information.

[...]

The term ?fingerprint? was severely off-putting for many users.
Thankfully, there are several ways to avoid this discomfort. Consider
adding ?microcopy? to the fingerprint pages?very brief, clear, and
concise copy telling the user that everything is okay, and that this
information isn?t anything threatening. In addition to microcopy, a
tertiary page can be created that explains the basics of what a
fingerprint is, why that information is important, and how to use that
information. This way, a space can be created to not only educate users
on encryption, but possibly catalyze their own self-guided education on
the matter.
""""""

Since we will be starting the process of designing a key management
interface (e.g. buddy list and fav local apps) for the various Commotion
clients, this is some good information to keep in mind.

   We should really look for other terminology that might avoid this 
reaction.  There have been some discussions on twitter and various 
listservs about this over the past couple of years, with no real 
resolution.  This is clearly important when it comes to questions of 
usability and user retention and how our software is perceived 
generally.  But I feel like we *also* have an opportunity to shape 
fingerprint/key verification across the entire space.  :D

I've been trying to get commotion built on barrier breaker.  Yes, this isn't supported, but I've got hardware that needs it. 

There are two major areas where things seem to break: hotplug and luci

Luci looks like just a version matching problem between trunk & packages. 

The more frustrating problem is with hotplug.  I can't get both wireless devices up at the same time. The olsr hotplug script seems to be run twice, once for the AP and once for the mesh interface. But the hotplug script detects both as wlan0. When I edit the script to use device instead of interface, the script recognizes the correct interface, but something breaks in queries to commotiond. 

Has anyone else been got beyond this?

I definitely agree that the crypto lingo definitely needs to be improved.
Unfortunately, I think that tweaking it here and there will only make it
worse.  For better or worse, ""fingerprint"" is the widespread term for that
thing.  And using a different word for it means that users will not be able to
tap into the existing body of knowledge around key fingerprints.

So if there is a crypto key fingerprint that the user has to know about, it
should be called a fingerprint.  And what we need to be working towards is
ways of representing crypto in a better way.  Here are some more of my more
recent thoughts on that topic:

It's great you're trying out BB with Commotion, I don't know of anyone
else who's given that a try yet.

I might also suggest looking at the mac80211.sh patch that comes with

due to the later version of netifd it comes with. I suspect Josh (CCed)
would have a better idea about this. Either way, we hope to upgrade to
BB once it is released as stable.

If you're able to get things to work, pull requests are more than
welcome. Let us know if you're able to figure out the problem!

1736,Commotion-dev, ubiquiti auto-reset,"Thu, 30 Jan 2014 16:25:41 -0500",-0500,Josh King,"Hi all,

I was speculating today about how we might be able to more smoothly
automate testing on our various testbed networks. Particularly, I was
thinking about how CONFINE uses a recovery device as a ""parent"" to power
cycle a stuck node (http://wiki.confine-project.eu/hw:recovery-device).
This made me think about how some Ubiquiti POEs have a reset button that
is able to send a signal over the wire to flip a node into TFTP mode in
the same way as the reset button on the node itself. I was wondering if
anyone was familiar with how that process actually worked (I assume
through sending some hi/low signal on one of the ethernet pins that the
chipset in the node recognizes), and if it was possible to simulate it
using an Arduino or similar. It would be great to be able to pair
testbed nodes with something like a raspberry pi that could remotely
reset and TFTP nodes with new firmware and run network tests independent
of the nodes themselves.

The hotplug scripts are already practically a deprecated system in 
Attitude Adjustment, so I imagine with Barrier Breaker we're going to 
be looking to use something else entirely. My intent is to have 
commotiond listen on ubus for network events, and to then configure 
OLSRd and the network directly, thus replacing many of our scripts. 
However, I don't anticipate working more on ubus bindings until after I 
have commotiond stable on desktop Linux, as Barrier Breaker still seems 
to be a ways out. I would be interested in working with anyone that 
wanted to do more general testing on Barrier Breaker, though, as it has 
a lot of interesting new features that I'm not fully familiar with yet.

A minor update is in place here:
The approach which was originally proposed by Musti did not turn out to be doable - unfortunately.

We are now looking at other solutions. RIOT-OS [1]  and 6lowpan came to mind.

Absolutely. But It might be good to have them speak on a different protocol and frequency.
Something like 6lowpan or zigbee.

1745,Commotion-dev, mesh speed,"Fri, 31 Jan 2014 11:11:24 -0600",-0600,Ben West,"Hi Marcio,

Does your screenshot show that you're using an HT40 mode, i.e. bonded 20MHz
channels?  I think 150Mbit/s is the maximum possible bitrate that would be
reported for a 20MHz channel, i.e. HT20 mode.  300Mbit/s is the maximum
possible rate for 40MHz channels.

Do note that the bitrate reported does not included factors like protocol
overhead.  Your link shows very good 69 dBm with very few TX retries, so
it's operating under favorable conditions (assuming noise floor is ~90
dBm).  Still, factors like ethernet protocol, 802.11 framing, artifacts of
TCP/IP stack, and driver/CPU limitations on the 2 devices you're testing
probably will cap transfer rate to somewhere around 40-50Mbit/s one way.

I run AA r39154 (not Commotion) on a collection of UBNT M5 radios, used as
a backhaul adhoc mesh, and my own casual tests on transfers rates over this
mesh suggest 20 - 40Mbit/s in actual traffic is going to be upper limit I
can expect.  That is, ~40Mbit/s max for a single hop route, and ~20Mbit/s
max for a 2-hop route, albeit over 40MHz channels on 5.8GHz band.  Channels
on 2.4GHz band will almost certainly be slower due to more ambient noise.

Faster rates would be possible with 3x3 MIMO devices like a UBNT
Powerbridge, e.g. 70-80Mbit/s under ideal conditions.

No doubt a different frequency would be good. I think our initial use 
case, at least, is a little different from the CONFINE stuff. 
Primarily, we'd be looking to automate testing on our internal testbed 
as part of our CI process. So we could hook Jenkins up to a script that 
would push images out to the supervisor devices as they're built, and 
those would reflash the nodes and run tests. The appeal of getting TFTP 
mode on the Ubiquiti devices is that we could automate reflashing the 
testbed even if a build is bad; we don't have to worry about anything 
on the node working correctly.

There are probably other ways to approach this problem as well, though, 
such as other hardware that's even easier to reflash at a moment's 
notice.

1747,Commotion-dev, Update on commotion-router under x86,"Fri, 31 Jan 2014 13:20:51 -0600",-0600,Ben West,"Teasing out this topic from the thread on UBNT auto-reset ...

To more thoroughly beat the dead horse of running commotion-router as an
x86 guest under VM-Ware, I can now confirm that trunk (and presumably
Barrier Breaker) works just fine under VM-Ware, and specifically with the
TP-Link USB adapter TL-WN821N v3.  This would presumably offer another
option for reflash-free firmware testing.  Indeed, I've run recent
commotion-router as a VM-Ware guest, along with a copy of Puppy Dog linux
as a 2nd guest, and used Firefox on Puppy Dog to complete QuickStart on the
commotion-router guest.

However, the current generation of commotion-router derived from AA seems
to have something wrong at the kernel level, which prevents the USB wifi
adapter from reliably initializing on boot.  This messes with QuickStart
and another auto-configuration tools, who see no wireless interface at all
on power-up and react as expected (i.e. badly).  A possible work-around
I've found is to include the package *usbreset*, and then issue the
usbreset command at some appropriate point during power-up to bring the USB
wifi adapter up, so that Commotion's auto-config routines can proceed
normally.  That is, issuing usbreset at the command line on the VM-Ware
guest commotion-router seems to reliably bring up the USB radio for me,
allowing me to run QuickStart on the Puppy Dog guest.

I realize few people care about VM-Ware, but my suspicion is that since the
kernel-level problem with USB adapters and commotion-router (and OpenWRT)
seems to go away entirely when I exchange the commotion-router guest with
an openwrt-trunk guest, this problem may *also* currently affect folks
wanting to run Commotion with a USB radio on devices like a raspberry PI.

Likewise, commotion-router's eventual migration to Barrier Breaker could
resolve this problem, too.

I'm trying to set aside time to update these presently out-of-date wiki
pages about Commotion under VM-Ware, at least to include the patched I've
been using for mac80211 and the ath9k_htc driver.

Yes, probably. Please note that I however just noticed the discussion about 
the CONFINE wiki page and the planned reset device and I wanted to point out 
that this particular approach was unfortunately abandoned. We might get back 
to this approach later, but not right now. Reason: lack of resources and time.

Does anyone have experience with OpenWRT's stack smashing protection

haven't had any luck.

I can enable SSP in menuconfig and build the Commotion image with no
problems, but that doesn't seem to add the stack-protector flag to any
of the build options.

I've tried adding -fstack-protector, -fstack-protector-all, and
-fstack-protector-strong to CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, and TARGET_CFLAGS in the
Makefile of my test package, which contains a vulnerable buffer

Any idea what I'm missing?

Yup! I regularly have the very same issue with that in the openwrt build system.
Seems like it is not very well tested by developers. But IMHO that should be highly used.

While talking about these security topics:
The other thing that I definitely recommend  is to take a look at the random number generators and their useage in openwrt.
It might make sense to generate keys somewhere else and copy them to the embedded device (in case that it possible) or to at least wait for some time and collect network traffic and then generate new keys.
By default the entropy is very low.

Currently we usually look at the viz for a quick snapshot of the network
health.

When we are looking to see if a link works, or if a node is online we
turn it on and scan for that link or node. When we have a problem we
turn on the viz and look for the color of the link to see if it is a
routing problem.

We often compare viz data with ping tests to the services/internet that
we are trying to reach through those nodes.

The colored lines, node names, and different icons for gateways vs.
non-gateway nodes are really useful for getting an at-a-glance view of
the network. Though, we would like solid lines and the nodes to be solid
colors so it is easier to identify things at a glance.

We HATE the auto-sort jitter/movement of the current viz. It means that
we have to spend time clicking and dragging nodes back on screen to see
what the network looks like.  The ETX value is also confusing to new
node administrators Since it is on a scale of [1-5/infinity]. It should
probably be replaced by another value on a scale of 0-100% or some other
scale that makes sense to people who don't have OLSR's link quality
algorithm memorized.

1. We have an auto-configuration script that is close to completion for 
Babel.
Babel should work natively with IPv4 and IPv6 in the end.

2. We have implemented scripts to auto-assign IPv6 prefixes to nodes 
based on RFC4193 and BCP106.
Prefixes are used to issue a default unique-local address to the network 
interface used for the lan where computers that host services or connect 
to the mesh are connected. In the end, the node will also be able to 
dynamically assign addresses to this lan. A 48 bit prefix is generated. 
It leaves 16 bits for the node owner for subnetting as needed.

3. We have made some modifications to the web interface to be able to 
activate Babel within it.
Right now, selecting Babel as the ?Protocol of the new interface? starts 
babeld and assigns an IPv6 prefix if it's not already present. From what 
we understand, the web interface is a very important piece of the 
Commotion firmware. We understand that our modifications here may not be 
accepted.

During the month, we will start to divide these functionalities and 
create pull-request. The most important points for us are 1. and 2.

Thank you in advance for your help in the next days and have a nice day!

The LuCI work will have to wait on the rest of Commotion to be merged

26th on your LuCI changes.

We are excited to get your work integrated. I actually just added Babel
into the Commotion config-editor in the upcoming Commotion desktop

Good to see I was not totally off base.

Also, Genevi?ve and xmbi are mentioned in the latest release notes for

Isn't that article a bit over stating what the Multipeer Connectivity
framework provides? Isn't the framework more like a super-bonjour, then
a full-fledged IP mesh?

Based on what I am reading here:
https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/MultipeerConnectivity/Reference/MultipeerConnectivityFramework/Introduction/Introduction.html

it seems that way.

The only that seems new to me is that you can use it over Bluetooth
without specifically having to pair... is it also somehow automatically
using adhoc wifi?

Thanks for opening this discussion on the hearbleed exploit. This is
definitely an issue with OpenSSL on openwrt.

For Commotion, we are using cyassl rather than openssl, so it should be
less of an issue for Commotion. Due dilligence though, we are testing
the exploit against Commotion nodes running cyassl to confirm that we're ok.

We're doing a lot of manual testing for our Commotion releases these
days, including a lot of browser-based tests of the luci interfaces. For
example, we check all fields for proper input validation, make sure file
upload widgets work, check all the links, etc.

I've been looking at Selenium to try to automate some of the work. It

Have any of you used Selenium or similar products enough to favor one or

aspects: homomorphic encryption, safely sharing keys in presence of
adversary (not sure if this refers to forward secrecy?), authenticating
client code even when served from malicious server.

http://css.csail.mit.edu/mylar/

""""""
Mylar is a platform for building secure web applications.

Web applications rely on servers to store and process confidential
information. However, anyone who gains access to the server (e.g., an
attacker, a curious administrator, or a government) can obtain all of
the data stored there. Mylar protects data confidentiality even when an
attacker gets full access to servers. Mylar stores only encrypted data
on the server, and decrypts data only in users' browsers. Simply
encrypting each user's data with a user key does not suffice, and Mylar
addresses three challenges in making this approach work. First, Mylar
allows the server to perform keyword search over encrypted documents,
even if the documents are encrypted with different keys. Second, Mylar
allows users to share keys and data securely in the presence of an
active adversary. Finally, Mylar ensures that client-side application
code is authentic, even if the server is malicious. Results with a
prototype of Mylar built on top of the Meteor framework are promising:
porting 6 applications required changing just 35 lines of code on
average, and the performance overheads are modest, amounting to a 17%
throughput loss and a 50 msec latency increase for sending a message in
a chat application.

1798,Commotion-dev, Proposed repository consolidation,"Fri, 18 Apr 2014 14:00:58 -0400",-0400,Josh King,"Hi all,

So, I just wanted to float this idea. We have quite a large number of
repositories, and this makes it rather difficult to manage all of the
issues in the project across them in an organized way. We basically
spend a pretty significant amount of time trying to keep everything in
sync. As a result, I'm considering some pretty aggressive refactoring in
order to collapse a bunch of repositories into each other and archive
deprecated ones. I'd appreciate some feedback on how this would work:

* With our new cross-platform client work, we were already planning on
consolidating our several Linux and eventually our Windows and Mac
repositories into the Commotion Client repo. This would combine
luci-commotion-linux, nm-dispatcher-olsrd, commotion-linux-py,
commotion-mesh-applet, and eventually commotion-windows and
commotion-winmesh.

* Commotion-router and commotion-feed would be consolidated.

* All of the LuCI components would be consolidated, although they would
still build separate packages as they do now. This would combine
luci-commotion, commotion-lua-helpers, luci-commotion-apps,
luci-commotion-splash, commotion-debug-helper,
commotion-dashboard-helper, luci-theme-commotion, and
luci-i18n-commotion. To the extent that makes sense, we would try and
keep the code separate and clear within the repository, and use github
issue labels to designate issues that pertain to specific components.
However, most likely the versioning for those packages will have to be
in lockstep.

* OTI would grab a copy of these repositories that are no longer used,
and then delete them: serval-crypto, avahi-client, co_httpinfo,
shell-fork, olsrd-mdp.

The intent of this would be to reduce the number of repositories we have
from 40 or so to a much more manageable number, as well as reduce
confusion by removing unused repositories. However, I wanted to make
sure that this wasn't going to interfere too much with people who wanted
to use components of Commotion separately; for the LuCI packages
especially, although despite the fact that they'll live in the same git
repository, they'll still be built as separate components.

I'd been having problems with the v0.6.5-4 version of olsrd in OTI's git

specifically with repeater nodes seeing their route to the Internet

1803,Commotion-dev, Merged olsrd branch commotion + release-0.6.6,"Wed, 23 Apr 2014 16:54:42 -0500",-0500,Ben West,"So far, the specific atheros repeater node where I'd been having apparent
SmartGateway issues seems to be OK now after upgrading its local olsrd to
v0.6.6.1 yesterday (along with the same on the affected gateway nodes).  It
does indeed look like the SmartGateway updates have yielded improvement for
my situation.

I should point out that *option 'SmartGatewayUseCount' '1'* is needed to
tell the newer SmartGateway code to only use one gateway at a time.  The
OLSR folks are now testing out multiple gateway nodes simultaneously in
HEAD, but I believe it doesn't play wall with typical NAT configurations,
so just use one gateway at a time for now.

The rationale for the timing tweaks from Ferry are somewhat opaque to me.
The old ROBIN mesh firmware using olsrd v0.5 did deploy similar tweaks:

Antonio from ROBIN published a the calculations behind these timings on his
wiki http://wiki-robin.meshroot.com/ , but unfortunately that site now
seems lost to the sands of time (and likewise to archive.org).

It is likely these params are unnecessary.  I was initially wanting to
mimic Ferry's suggested config to rule out problems.

I can see about making the PR to the commotion branch later today.

First of all thanks for your awesome work.

I'd like to go straight to a quick question:

If there were a possibility to include Commotion Android in stock ROMs by an
OEM, would commotion still need root on runtime? or is root needed only for
installation?

There is actually a chance of this happenning according to conversations with
an OEM here in Venezuela called S?ragon[0]. I've been talking to the mobiles
branch coordinator about a new project here called WifiAbierto[1] and he is
interested on adding mesh capabilities to their products by default.

I'd be glad to give him good news and to start a project with them on this
matter, of course with your kind support.

Hi folks!

After meeting with the contact person at S?ragon this are the key points to
work on the integration for their mobile products:

- They need to certify all software with Google's. All apps must pass CTS and
GMS tests [0].
- They need all apps to be able to run without root
- i18n will be a key issue as their market is mainly in Latin America.

They actually have a documentation platform for their build process[1] and
public repos at GitHub[2]. I handed links to commotion's project homepage,
wiki and GitHub repos.

They are pretty much willing to work on this. So, we could check this
requirements and meet again with them to define a roadmap.

devices, and how we have discussed that it isn't necessarily the best idea.

The problem with Ubiquiti devices is that they don't have a large amount
of memory to store the data for QoS, so as traffic gets heavier,
performance can take a big hit. This is just a guess, but I wouldn't
enable QoS in OpenWRT or Commotion on any device that has less than 64MB
of RAM (not flash). Just for reference, the Ubiquiti PicoStation M and
NanoStation M routers we have used for building our test networks have
only 32MB of RAM. Ubiquiti Rocket M series devices have 64MB of RAM though.

As we work towards supporting more router models, QoS performance
impacts will be something worth testing.

I wanted to mention this on the list (and I believe others have
mentioned it in the past - Ben I'm looking in your direction), and ask
what QoS or rate limiting folks are doing on their networks, and how
well does your solution work?

router models and would love to hear from the community on this list
about what routers you're using or would like to use with Commotion.

I've put together a summary blog post with more info:
http://commotionwireless.net/blog/2014/05/13/little-box-of-routers/

With our upcoming point release (Commotion Router 1.1), we'll be adding
supported images for several routers:

- TP Link WDR4300
- Mikrotik RB411AH
- Buffalo G300NH
- Buffalo AG300N

In general, Commotion Router has these system requirements:

- Wireless chipset (target) is ar71xx or atheros
- The router has greater than 4MB of flash
(4MB is recommended for optimal support - we're working on images for
the many routers with 4MB of flash memory)
- The router supports OpenWRT 10.x Attitude Adjustment or greater

We’ve compiled a list of potentially compatible routers on our wiki as a
guide
(https://wiki.commotionwireless.net/doku.php?id=development_resources:router:hardware_compatibility_list)


But we'd also like to hear from you to help focus our list to support
hardware that's available in your area. We'd particularly like to hear
from folks who are not in the US.

If you are interested in helping out and have one or more of the routers
on our list, contact us! We’ll even build a testing image for you if
your device is compatible!

OpenWRT friendly, so adding Commotion support could be as simple as adding
another target to the buildbot's runlist.

1829,Commotion-dev, Commotion IP ranges for multiple mesh,"Tue, 27 May 2014 14:15:21 -0400",-0400,Dan Staples,"Hi Miles,

The way we do IP addressing now is that each node will auto-generate IP
addresses for its interfaces based on the most significant bytes of the
device's MAC address. The mesh IP is in the 100.64.0.0/10 range, while
access point and ethernet interfaces are bridged and give out addresses
on the 10.0.0.0/8 range. We've often had the scenario where we'll want
to mesh over the upstream subnet (e.g. meshing over ethernet on a
switch), but creating multiple, non-overlapping mesh networks with the
same devices is a new use case for us.

So in other words, suggestions are welcome! Unless you want to
pre-provision all the IP addresses on the network, it seems like you'll
need a new scheme for auto-generating addresses that won't result in
collisions. Perhaps partitioning the 100.64.0.0/10 space into 3 separate
subnets might be one solution?

Hmm, not sure if olsrd logs to syslog or not. I usually just run olsrd
in the foreground to view the debug output. You might also have to
recompile olsrd with debugging on, since I'm not sure if the debs on the
Commotion website were compiled with it on or off.

I do not have a commotion router set up yet. Just 2 laptops and 2 Pis.

I had to patch the commotion mesh applet so that I could invoke the mesh 
status window ( without the patch the ""show mesh status"" option is 
always disabled, unless you can connect with encryption, which is 
impossible unless you are using an atheros chipset ). I haven't posted 
the patch or the patched debs yet, but it's on my list. Is this 
something I could post on the GitHub page? How can I get involved with 
development on the linux side of things?

All of these connect nicely and show internet access on the nodes 
connected to my LAN. However, when the nodes mesh together, the only 
node that shows a default route of any kind is the one actually 
connected to the LAN.

I ordered a Ubiquity router and some wifi dongles with Atheros chipsets.

I am pretty sure it's installed, I will need to confirm. If I up the

For running multiple instances of olsrd, one for each separate network
you're setting up, that will have to be done manually as the Commotion
web interface doesn't support that. I haven't run multiple olsrd
instances on a node before so I'm not sure how they will handle both
updating the routing table. I imagine if each instance doesn't have
overlapping HNA networks, and perhaps doesn't receive routes to the same
subnets elsewhere, they won't clobber each other when updating the
routing table. But again, I don't know as I haven't tried.

As far as Serval relying on the olsrd routes, that's just a thing we
have to live with for now. We've been talking with the Serval folks
about a way to decouple serval-dna's built-in routing from the MDP
overlay network, but as of now there is no solution. They might be able
to shed more light on that matter.

> How do you handle mixed 5ghz and 2 ghz devices today when bridged over Ethernet?  

How do you mean? Right now, using the OpenWRT built-in menus (under the
Advanced tab in the new Commotion interface), you can use both radios
and set up virtual interfaces on each as you need. And you could add an
interface on the 2.4ghz radio and an interface on the 5ghz radio into a
bridge with the ethernet interface if you like.

I suppose that could work, but again you'd need a new algorithm for
auto-generating IPs in each of those ranges if you didn't want to set
the IPs manually.

supports generating random IPs in arbitrary ranges, not just the default
100.64.0.0/10. If you create profiles in /etc/commotion/profiles.d on
the router, just set the 'ip' parameter to an IP in the range you wish
(for instance, it's 100.64.0.0 by default) and 'ipgenmask' to the
netmask for the corresponding range in which you want to generate an IP
(255.192.0.0 by default). Then you would set assign that profile to the
corresponding mesh interface in /etc/config/network. As an example, you
could have a profile in /etc/commotion/profiles.d/commotion2ghz with the
parameters 'ip: 100.64.0.0' and 'ipgenmask: 255.192.0.0', and
/etc/commotion/profiles5ghz with parameters 'ip: 192.168.0.0' and
'ipgenmask: 255.255.0.0', and then in /etc/config/network set the
profile option for each interface to be 'commotion2ghz' or
'commotion5ghz'. On the next network reload, it will assign new IP
addresses in those ranges.

As for OLSRd, you can add more than one mesh interface. OLSRd, however,
by default adds everything to the kernel's main routing table, which
means that the node will try and forward traffic between your different
subnets. It might make sense in any event to try and achieve the
separation you're talking about (if I understand correctly) with
firewall rules rather than different OLSR instances. Because otherwise,
unless you set up OLSR to set things in different routing tables in the
kernel (and I'm not entirely sure what effect that will have on normally
routed traffic), it will try and all the routes to the default kernel
routing table whether or not you're running two instances.

1847,Commotion-dev, Doxygen generated documentation,"Fri, 06 Jun 2014 15:18:09 -0400",-0400,Nat Meysenburg,"
Hi folks,

I'm happy to announce that we have just added some Doxygen generated API
references to the Commotion Wireless site. Right now we have
documentation for commotiond and the upcoming version of
commotion-client (the future of what is now the Linux client). 

You can find them at: https://commotionwireless.net/developer/api 

Please take a look around. If you see anything amiss (broken links,
weird formatting, etc.), please either email me or, even better, open an
issue against the commotion-docs repo on GitHub:
https://github.com/opentechinstitute/commotion-docs 

Also, if there are any repos in our codebase that you want to see us add
Doxygen documentation for, please open an issue. Posting those may be
limited to the extent to which we've actually written comments for that
code. 

If you are interested in generating your own documents for Commotion
sources, I wrote a helper script that is distributed with the code for
this site itself. You can find that here:
https://github.com/opentechinstitute/commotion-docs/tree/staging/scripts/doxygen 

Hopefully the next iteration will also contain links to the LaTex
version of the Doxygen documents. If anyone has good ideas or pointers
on how to present those, I'm all ears. 

Cheers,
~~Nat

I have begun playing with the Commotion Client code and have become 
totally obsessed :)

I have dropped all work on the old client and the work I was doing on 
the RPi to focus on the new version of Commotion Client. I just got an 
ubiquity picostation m2hp router and will put the CW firmware onto that 
for testing.

I see there have been a lot of updates since the previous client became 
deprecated. In order to begin playing with the code I have needed to 
make a number of updates to the utilities present. Here is what I have 
figured out so far (please correct me if I am wrong on anything!!!!):

Commotion client requires commotiond, serval-dna and 
commotion-service-manager. I want to do all the installs I can via 
package management so I started out by forking Natmey's 
commotion-deb-builder and modifying it to pull the best packages to use 
with commotion-client. I also fixed some bugs in the scripts. Once I get 
the perfect repo file sorted out I will commit that. Fork is here:

https://github.com/Shamanon/commotion-deb-builder

The serval-dna by OTI seems to be deprecated along with serval-crypo so 
I forked Serval Project's serval-dna and am almost done debianifying the 
package using dh_make and the OTI serval-dna/debian as a starting point. 
I also added an empty directory ""objs"" to prevent errors in compilation 
(that part was a hack as the problem needs to be fixed in their makefile 
or something). My fork isn't quite working with git-builddebpkg yet, but 
I am close. Today for sure.

https://github.com/Shamanon/serval-dna

Debian files for commotion-service-manager seem to be outdated as well. 
They are requiring serval-crypto and luci-commotion. serval-crypto is 
marked as deprecated nor is it listed on the project outline as 
required. I have started by removing that requirement in my fork. I am 
wondering if luci-commotion should still be a requirement?

I figure while I am on a roll, I will debianify commotiond as well. I 
assume that will need to be done at some point anyway.

Once I get the debianification sorted out for everything I will get 
started on the client.

Sounds like you're making some great progress on learning the core
components of Commotion.

If you haven't found it already, there is some great documentation on
our planned Architecture and Development notes on Commotion Client on
it's repository's Github wiki:
https://github.com/opentechinstitute/commotion-client/wiki

All pages are organized into a comprehensive technical architecture and
development guide:
https://github.com/opentechinstitute/commotion-client/wiki/commotion-client-architecture

Any progress you are able to make here would be amazing!
Thanks for being so enthusiastic.

Thanks. This is exactly the project I was planning on starting myself, 
luckily I found you guys and it's already going. The enthusiasm is easy 
on my end, glad to see there are many others with my vision.

I got a decent deb build working for Serval Project's serval-dna 
incorporating a bunch of the scripts from OTI's serval-dna debian 
folder. I can install/uninstall the serval-dna development fork, 
including libs/includes/etc,  however, commotiond doesn't want to 
compile against this version of serval-dna. Compilation of commotiond 
errors out stating that the llseek64 system call is not available. So 
far my only guesses are:

1. I am missing a dependency. (manpages-dev is supposed to provide 
llseek64 but installing said package did not help)

2. commotiond needs to use OTI's version of serval-dna

3. I need to rebuild SP's serval-dna as package class ""single"" vs ""indep""

If anyone could shed some light on this, that would be great.

If I build and install OTI's serval-dna I am able to compile commotiond 
without problem.

As for the commotion-service-manager, does this still require 
luci-commotion? Luci-commotion fails to install on requirement for the 
deprecated serval-crypto.

I have read most of the development docs and road-maps, but of course I 
may have missed something. It seems the goal is to move to using SP's 
serval-dna (for full serval compatibility) vs the OTI fork, is this 
correct? Is OTI's serval-crypto deprecated because crypto is now handled 
by SP's serval-dna?

My nick is shamanon on IRC and I am in the #commotion channel if anyone 
wants to strike up a conversation there.

Thanks!

The serval-dna plugin for commotiond is currently made to build against
a specific version of libservald, which you can checkout in the
'commotion-wireless' branch of OTI's fork of serval-dna.

There is a _new_ version of the commotiond plugin that I'm working on
that builds against a later version of libserval, which is in the
'refactoring' branch of commotiond. This branch should build against the
'serval-multi-key' branch of OTI's fork of serval-dna, though testing is
still in progress.

Commotion-service-manager is also something I'm working on refactoring
and upgrading, but I believe the master branch of CSM should still be
compatible with the new versions of commotiond/serval-dna. The Debian
packaging for CSM hasn't been updated to reflect the new dependencies
however. If you're interested in doing that, that would be rad.
Luci-commotion, like serval-crypto, is no longer a dependency. We should
also add avahi-daemon to the Package dependencies, and
libavahi-client-dev to the Source dependencies.

We'd eventually like to use the Serval Project's debian package of
serval-dna, but for now we have some incompatibilities we still depend
on. Long term we'll probably drop the serval-dna plugin for commotiond
and just use serval-dna itself. The only reason we don't do that now is
because of size constraints on the router platform.

1860,Commotion-dev, Commotion Router v1.1.rc2 released!,"Mon, 16 Jun 2014 10:58:39 -0400",-0400,Josh King,"Hi all,

I'm pleased to announce that we've just posted the second release
candidate for the stable 1.1 version of the Commotion Router firmware.
This version patches a memory leak in our Serval plugin, and also
includes a number of small bugfixes and interface tweaks. You can find
the release notes here:

https://commotionwireless.net/blog/2014/06/13/commotion-router-1.1rc2-release-notes/

and downloads here:

https://commotionwireless.net/download/routers/

We currently have images for a selection of Ubiquiti routers posted, and
will be posting images for select TP-Link and Buffalo routers shortly.
Pending completion of testing on one of our larger community testbed
networks, this release will hopefully become v1.1 final within the next
week or two.

1861,Commotion-dev, Repository Consolidation,"Wed, 18 Jun 2014 12:37:08 -0400",-0400,Josh King,"Hi all,

Back in April, I proposed on the list a strategy for consolidating and
cleaning up several of our many repositories. Today, I'm pushing forward
on that. This should not have a major effect on most developers; the
main change right now is that we are consolidating all of our
LuCI-related repositories into luci-commotion (except for
luci-i18n-commotion). Additionally, all version numbers for those
packages will be synced up, although they will still be built as
separate packages by our build system. We will also be moving all open
issues from those separate github projects into luci-commotion. Finally,
we will also be backing up and then deleting several unused
repositories, including the LuCI projects that have just been vacated.

Hopefully this should all be complete by the end of today, although
there may be some build breakage for Commotion Router as this is
happening. With any luck, this will result in a more straightforward and
easier to manage structure for our many github projects.

I'm having problems with the following mesh
Subnet -> wifi -> Device F ->ethernet link -> Device C -> wifi link -> Device A or Device E

C gets updates from F, A and E.   Route table looks good & it can connect to Subnet and the other routers. 

F  only gets routes for C.

all hosts are using the same serval keyring & signing key.  All are rc1.1r2. 
Each node has a wired ether interface and a mesh interface.  The wired interface is unplugged except for nodes F & C. 

I suspect that part of my problem may be with HNA.

Host F, 1.34 is a buffalo I built from master.

Host E  is the same as F, but without NTP - clock skew causes F to drop all packets  from E, but sometimes they work?


And as final proof, disabling serval signing makes everything work. 

Sigh. 


Is there a good way to bootstrap a serval signed mesh without an Internet gateway?

Also, did things work with serval signing off and the original firewall

additional barrier.

3 ubiquiti nodes will mesh using serval over wifi. As you said, it takes a few minutes,(but not more than 5) to settle. 
2 Buffalo nodes will mesh over wifi. 
1 buffalo node ""Center"" is connected to one ubiquiti over ethernet.  Turning off serval signing makes everything work as expected through node Center.

Turn on serval, and center sees buffalos, but will not communicate with the ubiquiti device.  

Thoughts for what to test/debug next? 

The buffalos were build using master last week. Ubiquitis are 1.1rc2.  Does master play nicely with 1.1 right now?  The next thing I can think of to try is to rebuild with commotion feed as 1.1 and see if getting the same olsrd version will magically fix things.

1872,Commotion-dev, meshing over ethernet,"Wed, 02 Jul 2014 17:29:41 -0400",-0400,Dan Staples,"Hey Miles,

That sounds like a good plan B to me, if we can't fix this issue. But we
(and by that I mean folks at the office other than me) did some testing
today to see if we could figure out the problem you're seeing. Here's
what they found:

Serval route signing between Buffalo and Ubiquiti routers causes
commotiond and olsrd to seg fault (but works fine in Ubiq-only meshes).
Debugging it indicates that it's a memory-related architecture-specific
problem in commotiond. The hardware we used to replicate the issue were
Ubiquiti Picostation and Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH.

We already have one open memory-related fix for commotiond that may or
may not solve the problem:
https://github.com/opentechinstitute/commotiond/pull/103. We'll do some
more testing today and tomorrow and let you know anything else we find.

Thanks for your patience with this and hopefully we'll be able to
resolve the problem.

We have uncovered the root of the problem and wanted to share the findings.

First of all, thank you for your patience with us as we debugged this
issue. Without your input, we would never have realized that this was a
problem.

In cases like yours, olsrd is meshing over two different interfaces.
There is a primary interface address that labels the node throughout the
network and there are other, secondary, addresses that label the
individual interfaces.

In the Serval route signing plugin, we use those labels to index a table
of timeouts/timestamps. The values from this table are used to locate
the proper key, the proper timestamp skew, etc.

When a node has multiple interfaces, the plugin gets confused about
which label to use to index that table. As a result, the skews never
converge and the routes cannot be signed.

We are going to start looking at possible solutions for this problem as
soon as possible. We cannot promise a fix before the start of Toorcamp
next week, but we are going to do our best. We will keep you posted on
our progress and send you any fixes.

In the meantime, the only way to work around the problem is to mesh on a
single interface per node.

I hope this information helps. As I said, we will keep you posted!

Thanks again for all the input you've given us!

So, please (apparently) disregard my previous messages. The root of the
problem is conceptually more simple (although I haven't yet started
thinking about the fix):

It appears that MDP expects
challenge/challenge-response/response-response messages (i.e. MDP
control packets) to be the very first message in any OLSR packet. That
means that if any of those messages is not first, then they will get
missed. This is obviously a problem.

The pico stations never seem to append any packets before an MDP control
packet. The Buffalo router does. I think it's more of a timing/packet
size issue, but the Buffalo router is a good test case because it
exercises this little ""gem"".

Now, on to the fix. I am hoping to get something going tonight. I will
keep everyone posted!

When a node sends out a challenge control message (a), if it receives a
challenge message from (a) before it receives a challenge response
control message, the whole things goes to pot. This is incredibly common
in the scenario when nodes are meshing over multiple interfaces. Once
this problem is resolved, I think we will have a complete solution.

you need:

power-switchable usb-ports (f.i. tplink 4300)
* usb to serial interface
* a router for being tested
* last but not least: a master/slave power strip, which is controlled by 
usb.

i cant find such a power strip in US stores but hope that you will find

That would be good for a lab with multiple devices. For a single device, if
you want to save a little money and you don't mind using GPIO instead of

First I'm coming out with a full wrapper for commotionlib, that should
allow to write a full blown client or daemon in Lua. Later, as I get
more acquainted with the API I will think in how to get it to work in
a ""modular"" way ""within commotionlib"".

In the next few days I'll be done with the code generator and within
the next few weeks the LuaAPI should be compiled and ready for the
next step:

To run leaking almost everything... to allow me to understand what's
needed for correct garbage collection: The issue is that Lifespan of
different objects, differs from their presence in Lua, some exist only
while ""in Lua"" (and get destroyed by it) some others are to be
delegated to someone else, while some are just to be left alone).

It is evident to me that the solution to the problem goes through how
to use the flags field of co_obj_t .

The key to successful memory management is having a clear idea of who
is to take care, when and how,  of the destruction of objects ( ""the
trinity"" of garbage collection).

So evidently what we need to convey in the flags field is enough
information to be able to easily come out with this ""trinity"".

I was thinking in using few of the LSBs to convey ""who"" is delegated,
an leave the MSBs to ""the delegate"" as each one has its own demands.

some of the values I'm thinking for the ""who subfield"" are:
 - ""somewhere in the stack""... a return will destroy it... (useful to
know as I may want to make my own copy if it has to predictably
persist)
 - ""no one"" static object.. will persist forever..
 - one of some ""actors"": e.g. the Lua machine, This or that module.

In this scenario and we need to define some methods to delegate between actors.

1906,Commotion-dev, [commotiond:obj] Garbage collection and object,"Tue, 29 Jul 2014 14:42:45 -0400",-0400,Josh King,"Hi Luis,

I'm trying to fully understand how this will work; forgive me, I haven't
ever written lua bindings for a C library before. If it helps, I can try
and describe how memory management happens right now in libcommotion.

All objects are explicitly allocated and explicitly destroyed by the
caller; the library does not attempt to do garbage collection on its
own. The only instance where there is anything resembling garbage
collection is in the use of the halloc allocator, which is used
throughout the library. Halloc allows you to assign a particular block
of dynamic memory as the parent of another block of dynamic memory. This
allows one to build data structures (as we have done with co_list and
co_tree) where each object inserted into it is associated with the
structure, so that when the structure is freed, every one of its member
objects is freed as well. Again, the caller controls the use of this
functionality, as there are _unsafe insert functions that allow you to
insert an object without it being linked to the object as a whole. We
use this to queue up objects for the network socket without having to
worry about accidentally freeing the originals.

So basically I'm trying to figure out if there are any instances where
something that gets passed through the stack to lua will be the
responsibility of anything other than one of the 'actors' i.e. the
caller. And if so, something is getting passed through that has
ephemeral state or is static, whether we need to signal that or whether
that is an indication of a bug in how the library is handling that piece
of memory.

Vehicular communications is an interesting push-point to get ad-hoc support
in Wi-Fi, as car vendors may see sufficient value in it to push things
along.

How much 802.11p stuff is out there?
