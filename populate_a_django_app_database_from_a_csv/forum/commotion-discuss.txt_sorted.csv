This looks awesome, thanks for putting this together.  I especially like
the ""Identify the practices for"" with the 6 types of deployment
situations and the questions around determining how to establish the
project layers.

FYI, it looks like you've set it to be public rather than a request for
editing privileges.

This is a great start! As this gets fleshed out a bit, and answers for this
start getting filled in I think there would be a good bit of info that could
be gleaned from here into nice wiki documents.

Im going to start filling in answers inline following a pattern that
hopefully others will follow too, so we can both discuss and converge on

My name is Merouan, I am a PhD student in Political Science at McGill
University - Montr?al. I also heard about commotion through the french
website lemonde.fr and I immediately fell in love with the project!!

I am currently doing my research on the concept of ""informational cascades""
or why random instances of street protest spiral in some cases and not
others (for instance, I am trying to understand why would the
self-immolation of a street vendor trigger massive protests in Tunisia and
not elsewhere in the Arab world). Nothing tech related as you can see but I
do speak/write Arabic and French fluently and would be very very happy to
help with translations or anything else if need be.

Again, I would like to congratulate all those working on the project. Coming
from the Arab world, I can only testify on the importance of a free (and
secure) access to the internet for the defence of individual freedoms.

Cheers!

9,Commotion-discuss, New here & International Development,"Thu, 29 Sep 2011 17:38:25 +0100",+0100,laurence bascle,"Hi there,

better late than never!
I also discovered Commotion via Le Monde's article (so this is almost a
french speaker thread! ;), and currently working in the non-profit/human
rights sector, I was obviously thrilled.
I am Technical Project Manager though not a dev myself, and as such tend to
think more of the gap between developers and users/potential stakeholders. I
believe it would be great to get more plain language documentation (as
accessible say, as the so-successful-LeMonde-article) to promote the concept
and the progress of the project to potential community/institutional users.
Because the people who will use it are ultimately not devs, but say
emergency field workers and Human Rights Defenders (HRDs)! This in turn
might totally influence your roadmap (and if you have some vague idea to
service the 'third sector', then better develop something fits their need).

I have seen this wiki entry which is a great start I think
https://tech.chambana.net/projects/commotion/wiki/Newbie_How_it_Works
but as a non-dev there are still a few things I am struggling to understand:

1)  what are the USPs (Unique Selling Points) of this project compared to
other open source wireless mesh networks initiatives already used (like OLPC
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLPC_XO-1#Wireless_mesh_networking. Oh actually
just reading that ""Although one goal of the laptop is that all of its
software be open source <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source>, the
source code for this routing protocol is currently closed source"" booh!). I
understand one is the integration with TOR, but any others?

2) how is the access to the internet addressed, and bandwidth in particular
(access to a wider network for HRDs for example is strategically crucial).
It would be good to have a non-tech version of why/how 100s can access the
internet through the one point/computer and what kind of speed they can
expect.

3) Commotion routers and their role, and access from say deep Rural Northern
Uganda.

Ok, that's a lot to address, but hopefully there will be a few people out
there who are able to answer! I'd suggest best done via the wiki, and then
send us a link,
thanks!

I'm involved in Ume? Hackerspace, northern Sweden, and we're thinking 
(like so many others) that a wireless mesh network would be great to 
have in our neighbourhood. I've been looking at both Commotion and the 
Byzantium project (http://project-byzantium.org/) for inspiration, 
technology and software.

 From what I can tell Commotion currently has OpenWRT builds for some of 
the Ubiquiti hardware and from what I can tell from documentation this 
is a working solution albeit somewhat hacky and developer-oriented. I 
have a little bit of personal budget to kickstart this project and buy 
hardware to experiment with. My first test scenario is to at least have 
three APs/laptops working in a mesh to connect an apartment a couple of 
blocks away from the source internet connection.

Any experience-based suggestions on which hardware is best suited, 
general tips for putting up a network like this etc. for someone who's 
only used two OpenWRT boxes to ""bridge"" before?

And a bonus inquiry: are there any efforts (or ideas on how much effort 
it would mean) to put Commotion firmware onto common units like the

23,Commotion-discuss, Some pre-experimentation mesh hardware,"Wed, 27 Feb 2013 06:59:21 -0500",-0500,Andrew Reynolds,"Hello!

We tend to focus on Ubiquiti routers for convenience. We have a lot of
them for our own networks because they're reliable and hard to brick.
Commotion should theoretically run on any OpenWRT-compatible hardware
(http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start). The biggest problem we've run into
is that some of the smaller routers don't have enough storage for all
the Commotion packages. I believe there's a minimal Commotion
configuration somewhere in the developer archives. I will see if I can
find it.

The setup you describe sounds pretty straightforward. The routers should
just mesh, and there are a couple of ways to add a laptop/fileserver.
You could run the x86 live image, which will turn the laptop into a very
powerful openwrt node, or you could connect the laptop and router via
ethernet cable. Depending on your OS, this might be a good opportunity
to test the new Linux or OS X clients. They're still very rough, but
they might fit in a test network.

We are in the process of packaging and testing a new Commotion release,
which will add a lot of user interface improvements, as well as some
security features.

Finally, you can find all of our source code, including packages that
haven't been added to the official release, on our github account
(https://github.com/opentechinstitute).

Keep us posted on your progress.

It should be straightforward (although tedious) to prune down the current

Although, you would likely have to axe potentially useful features, e.g.
IPV6 support or Luci web UI.

Also, do be mindful of the RAM limitation for older devices like a WRT54G,

I've taken several stabs at trying to prune down previous iterations of
Commotion (i.e. pre DR1) to 4MB, while retaining the luci web UI, by having
the luci sources compressed or pre-compiled, by removing IPv6 support, and
by lots of other little snips and cuts to extraneous packages, but so far
no luck.

Both luci and openssl support seem to guarantee the images will be larger
than 4MB.  If you are to the point of writing a daemon in C, it may also
become worthwhile to either incorporate a very basic HTTP server into that
daemon (which is what coovachilli does) or incorporate bindings to uhttpd.
Probably the latter could be done with reasonable effort.

34,Commotion-discuss, Some pre-experimentation mesh hardware,"Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:02:42 -0600",-0600,Ben West,"Hi Josh,

Sorry for being unclear.  By 'uhttpd binding' I had mean using uhttpd as
the ultra-small HTTP server that it is, to respond to requests sent to
ports 80 and 443, but have commotiond serve a collection of HTML forms for
the mesh admin UI.

Indeed, since the OpenWRT build process already offers the option to
pre-compile luci/lua scripts into bytecode for reduced flash and CPU load,
I'm curious if more dramatic pre-compiling / stripping of luci could be
possible to produce to *just* the bare essentials needed for commotiond,
and possibly *less* than what OpenWRT considers a minimal luci
installation.  See below for reference:
http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials#minimalistic.offline.installation
http://trac.fonosfera.org/fon-ng/wiki/lua

Furthermore, I'm still assuming zram will also be handy to optimize RAM
usage on 16MB memory devices.  (Maybe 32MB devices too?)

If these methods are effective in pruning down the image size, a neat goal
would be to retain openssl support for tunnelling, etc.  A recent update to
trunk and AA now offloads some of the SSL computation to hardware on ath9k
24kc platform.

36,Commotion-discuss, Some pre-experimentation mesh hardware,"Thu, 28 Feb 2013 11:10:14 -0500",-0500,Dan Staples,"In our upcoming release, we use the Serval daemon as a core technology
of Commotion. In fact, due to a plugin we wrote to integrate Serval's
crypto functions to sign olsrd traffic with a shared key, mesh nodes
that lack this functionality and key cannot mesh with Commotion nodes
that do have it.

So I guess it comes down to what you mean by being a member of a
Commotion mesh. If that just means routing traffic, you could get by
with just servald and olsrd (with requisite plugins). But Commotion has
a whole bunch of other features that you wouldn't get with this setup.

If you can give us a greater idea of what functionality you want or
need, we could probably be more specific. Do you have the ability to get
hardware, or are you just able to use common units like the WRT54G? I
would recommend getting Ubiquiti nodes if you can; their picostation is
around $80USD. We are also working on developing Commotion clients of
Linux/Mac/Windows, which should be available in the near future, in case
you want to run Commotion on a laptop.

Because I'm thinking to buy more(bullet,nanostation..) in the near future, I 
want to be sure that my italian supplier is right.
Otherwise can you suggest a cheaper channel?

The Free Network Foundation ( http://www.thefnf.org/) recently went 
through a major relaunch of our website. We found that keeping things 
""shallow"" (no deep/multilevel link trees) helped immensely. 
Subscriptions to the mailing list, chili account creation, requests for 
information, volunteer offers etc went way up.

Full disclosure: I am the CTO and cofounder of the FNF, and participated 
heavily in the redesign/relaunch.

Hi Luigi,

Yes, both Nanostation models should work with Commotion. For a minimal
hardware, I would suggest the picostation. It's what we do our primary
development on, and is relatively cheap. Let me know if you have any
other questions!

If you are using our newest unstable release (DR1), there is a Quick

The code.commotionwireless.net site hosts a wiki where much information
exists. Other than that, we are just starting to build up an information
architecture that reflects the software where it is now. Before we were
mostly a custom openWRT build. Whereas, we are now actually a more
complex and multi-platform project.

The website is two fold, though not the best at either right now. It's
first goal is to inform new users on what Commotion is, and to provide
the tools to get them using it. The second purpose is to provide a easy
way for new developers to see how they can help with the project.

I like that idea, that is what the ""get started"" bubbles on the front

58,Commotion-discuss, Consideration for solar-powered urban mesh,"Sat, 1 Jun 2013 12:48:38 -0500",-0500,Ben West,"I am considering submitting a paper on this topic to the Int'l Summit for
Community Wireless
Networks<http://2013.wirelesssummit.org/content/deadline-extended%E2%80%9430-days-left-submit-proposals>conference,
being held this October in Berlin.  Feel free to respond with
comments, criticisms, and witticisms!

Short TL;DR version: low-cost solar/battery powered wifi mesh to let folks
with smartphones and laptops map out / organize / access resources in their
neighborhood, for semi-casual use during disaster recovery.

Longer version ...

Recent discussion with another St. Louisian pointed toward using the
Tidepools <http://tidepools.co/> application to enable users (accessing
Tidepools via smartphone wifi) to announce and locate resources and
exchange messaging within a neighborhood-wide wifi mesh, say something on
the order of 5 square miles for an initial deployment.

In particular, we were curious whether a *10 or 20-node rooftop mesh
powered entirely by solar/battery*, and with a local Tidepools server
running in that mesh, might make itself handy to folks recently deprived of
electrical power, phone, and other utilities.  Using the mesh could be
further incentivized by also providing limited (~1Mbit/s) Internet access,
to the extent feasible, such that disaster victims could keep up
correspondence via email, Facebook, Twitter, etc.  Furthermore, some of the
roof nodes could have additional hardware to provide *5Volt cell phone
charging ports* at ground level, powered by excess capacity in the node's
solar/battery package.  Also, we assume this mesh would operate 24/7
anyway, i.e. also during non-emergenies, to better familiarize neighborhood
residents with its presence and let them pre-populate the Tidepools map, if
desired.

What I'm curious about is the feasibility of constructing combined antenna
mast + solar panel assemblies that rest on rooftops, anchored by
cinderblocks, with sufficient rigidity/balast to withstand ~60mph wind w/o
damage or significant misalignment.  And for less than 500$US in materials
per rooftop node.  The wifi hotspots themselves create very little wind
loading, so I think a key detail is doing cheap/secure mounting of the
solar panel.  Likewise, I would expect to site rooftop nodes such that a
20-node mesh could continue to operate if even 30% to 40% of the nodes were
knocked offline (e.g. from localized tornado/microburst damage).

This proposal would leverage heavily off the development recently put into
the Commotion Wireless <https://commotionwireless.net/> firmware and
Tidepools <http://tidepools.co/> software developed by the conference
organizer Open Technology Institute <http://oti.newamerica.net/>, along
with the extreme low-cost outdoor mounting techniques I've been developing
via WasabiNet <http://gowasabi.net/content/your-rooftop>.

Your thoughts?

Finally, below is a quick breakdown I made for building a
solar/battery-powered roof node with less than 500$US of materials.
Considering that the wifi hotspot itself draws less than 20W, further
costing-down is possible.  Specifically, a smaller solar panel and smaller
12VDC/24VDC converter should be doable.

60,Commotion-discuss, Consideration for solar-powered urban mesh,"Sat, 1 Jun 2013 18:04:59 -0500",-0500,Ben West,"Hi Charles,

My thoughts about the use of smart phones and tablets come from observation
(1<http://www.sfgate.com/nation/article/After-Sandy-N-Y-recovering-but-slowly-3998882.php>,
2<http://www.northjersey.com/weather/After_Sandy_Things_improving_but_life_wont_be_back_to_normal_for_awhile.html>,
3<http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-30/sandy-knocks-out-cable-phone-service-to-1-million-in-new-york.html>)
of recent instances here in the US where a weather-related event caused
widespread power outages, and indeed queues formed at locations that still
had electrical power, of people wanting to recharge handhelds.

Phones and tablets usually have several hours of battery life, far better
than laptops.  Also, in extreme situations where the cell towers are all
out too, one could assume folks would only use their handheld while
connected to wifi, further reducing the power consumption.

As for a community charging station, my friend Dann Green (former St. Louis
resident / all-around geek) built this one recently.  This, however, is
definitely an order of magnitude above what I was considering for the solar
rooftop mesh nodes, which is namely just one or two mini-USB ports supplied
with 5V from the battery.

This things are very popular in Africa, India and Asia, so you could
get off-the-shelf solutions. This is just one which recently popped up
in our conversations:

I want to share more info about the test.
I used to ""commotion wifi"" ESSID.
The host PC (iPhone)was Wifi connected to the Client-WDS picostation.
The Adsl modem was connected to the LAN port of  POE of the second 
AP-WDS Picostation.
The two picostations are installed on two balconies(50 m up from ground) 
of my building .One balcony looking  North, the other one looking  West.
In this way I can distribute internet wirelessy over two areas that are 
located in orthogonal directions down to the street. The distance of the 
2 picostations is about  15 m each other but the RF signal has to go 
through the walls of the apartment and the attenuation is significant.
If I go with my iPhone on the street I can connect the iPhone  to 
Internet at a distance of about 100 m from the base of building on one 
direction and 100 m on the other direction.I have created  two internet 
hot spots  with only 1 Internet access.
The output power of the picostation has been set to 14 dBm because 
italian regulation.This is why the distance is not so significant.
But the configuration is good for testing.

Although I can't speak for Commotion developers at OTI, I think it its
likely they would not be able to support WDS modes very well at all.
Besides the partially-functional modes that you have discovered.

WDS is generally a proprietary extension of 802.11, whereby the flavors of
WDS developed by different manufacturers (e.g. Atheros, Broadcom) do not
inter-operate, probably by design.

http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clientmode#wds.-.wireless.distribution.system
http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/broadcomwds
http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/atheroswds

Likewise, I think the sort of STA-AP links that WDS builds will not play
well with either the captive portal or the firewall settings used in
Commotion-OpenWRT.

So, the instance of Commotion you have working here likely would not mesh
with any nodes running Commotion-OpenWRT firmware with canonical
configuration.

For the mode of meshing that Commotion OpenWRT (and commmotion-mesh-applet
under Ubuntu/Debian) depends on, the preferred approach to this topology is
to have the nodes talk to each other over a dedicated ad-hoc VIF (virtual
interface), and then have each node broadcast its public AP as an
additional VIF.  This approach avoids proprietary 802.11 extensions like
WDS, to ensure compatibility with as many wifi clients as possible.

Have you tried flashing the Picostations with the Commotion-OpenWRT images
available here (either stable PR3 or unstable DR1)?  The Picostation M2
radios should run the ""bullet"" images fine, and it seems they should work
for your 2-node mesh.
https://commotionwireless.net/download

Likewise, and to address your questions about Commotion under
Ubuntu/Debian, here are recent builds of the commotion-mesh-applet GNOME
applet, olsrd daemon, and NetworkManager agent:

olsr. That will at least tell you whether you're meshing.

Using the settings you used before, run the following:
olsrd -d1 -i wlan0 -f
/etc/nm-dispatcher-olsrd/profiles/commotionwireless.net.conf

Substitute your machine's wifi interface for wlan0 if necessary. You
might need to use iwconfig to tweak your bssid (02:CA:FF:EE:BA:BE) and
channel. The -d flag will show debug information, including current
neighbor list.

Incidentally, olsrd is actually called from nm-dispatcher-olsrd
(https://github.com/opentechinstitute/nm-dispatcher-olsrd), so you might
use that to determine how your interface is being configured, then see
if it's breaking down at commotion-mesh-applet.

68,Commotion-discuss, Commotion installation on Linux laptop,"Wed, 05 Jun 2013 15:32:04 -0400",-0400,Dan Staples,"Hi Luigi,

Sorry for taking a while to respond. There are two possibilities I can
think of why you might not be able to mesh with your laptop. The first
is that your wireless driver on your laptop simply doesn't support
ad-hoc mode; many do not, including my own laptop. Do you know what
chipset you are using? It would also help to see the output of ""lsmod"",
to see what drivers are loaded. You might want to also consider using a
USB wifi adapter that is known to do ad-hoc, such as the TL-WN821N:
http://www.tp-link.us/products/details/?model=TL-WN821N

The second idea is that, if you are using DR1 version of
Commotion-OpenWRT, then ad-hoc encryption is turned on by default, but
the nm-mesh-applet software currently does not support encryption. From
the router, can you give the output of ""iwinfo wlan0-1 info""? You will
see whether encryption is turned on or not.

Which olsrd package are you running on the Ubuntu machine? I had 
problems with pre-compiled binaries for .deb-systems (due to an 
optimization option Debian adds for gcc compiling).

Can you try building olsrd yourself and see if your Ubuntu node works 
then? (remember that when compiling yourself, usually binaries end up in 
/usr/local instead of /usr)

Dan,Mikael,Andrew thanks for your suggestions.

At the end It was possible to have the meshing between the 2 
Picostations and my Linux laptop.
Everything is working now.
Here the steps I did.

The first action was to verify if my laptop was supporting ad-hoc mode.
a) With ""lsmod"" I have  verified that the driver iwlwifi was installed.
b)With ""lspci -v"" I found the chipset of the wireless device:Intel 
Centrino Advanced-N6200.
It easy to find that the ad-hoc mode is supported.Go to 
http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/iwlwifi

c)I have investigated the second possibilty :if the router was 
supporting the encryption and the nm-mesh-applet not.
So I followed the suggestion of Andrew on Commotion-discuss Digest, Vol 
9, Issue 6,and I tried to connect by olsr

olsrd -d1 -i wlan0 -f /etc/nm-dispatcher-olsrd/commotionwireless.net.conf

and checking the encryption setting on the router and on my laptop(using scan).
I found several inconsistencies between the output of  the router  web page  and the laptop setting.And more ..
I don't want to report all the list of inconsistencies.
So I had the suspect that I was using an old release of the software.
I flashed the router with the available release  on April 2013.
For this trial I used the new ...openwrt-ar71xx-generic-ubnt-bullet-m-squashfs-factory.bin posted on 24/5/2013.

With this release everything worked at the first attempt.
So it is up to you,now,to explain the main differences between the current  release and the 1 month old one.

73,Commotion-discuss, Commotion DR1.1 Release,"Mon, 10 Jun 2013 11:09:18 -0400",-0400,Josh King,"Hi all,

Now that the download page on the main website is updated, I just wanted
to send out the release notes for our latest point release. This should
be the beginning of a more rapid release cycle. You can download DR1.1 at:

https://commotionwireless.net/download

Release notes below:

Commotion DR1.1 Release Notes

Developer Release 1.1 is the first stable release of the DR1 series.
This release is the beginning of our new stable branch, and represents a
significant step forward from our previous stable release.
What is a Commotion release?

Commotion release versions represent a target set of features for the
entire project
(http://code.commotionwireless.net/projects/commotion/wiki/Official_Version_Feature_Targets).
Software packages for individual platforms (Linux, Windows, etc.) may be
in different stages of development, and are labeled according to their
supported features.
Platform Availability:

Currently, only the OpenWRT-based router firmware is DR1 compatible.
Other platforms are under active development and are being brought up to
feature parity. Current platform revisions can be found on the Official
Version Feature Targets page.
Features:

    Easy-to-use setup wizard: The Commotion Quickstart provides a
simple, one-step interface for setting up a Commotion node.

    Local applications: The Commotion Apps Portal is an interface for
creating and browsing for local network applications.

    Common platform for managing settings: The Commotion Daemon provides
a common management interface for maintaining the configurations of
different community networks.

    Encryption tools: Commotion configures industry-standard IBSS-RSN
encryption by default, and provides the Serval crypto API to aid
developers in creating secure applications.

    Consistent visual style: New Commotion releases are all styled in
accordance with the Commotion Human Interface Guidelines
(http://commotionwireless.net/docs/hig/introduction).

    Simplified debugging: A new Commotion Debugging Helper tool makes it
easy to retrieve useful troubleshooting information from a node in the
event of a network problem.

Fixes:

    Innumerable fixes and changes went into this release since Preview
Release 3 (PR3), the previous stable branch. A complete list can be
found on the Commotion project site.

Megan's
(https://docs.google.com/a/opentechinstitute.org/document/d/1Z_ezmXbtUAyH8gTSlALf1hbbZnedXFBzm-1n0vxAF-U/edit)
had many good points on flattening out the links on this page. Currently
it is very nested. I think that we can collapse many of the sections
together to give more content per click to a user.

I like a variation of the  alternative she proposed with a top header of
(about, use, develop, blog, download, report a bug).

We should add a separate press-kit accessible from the footer so that we
can control teh messaging and content used by press around Commotion.
Our press is one of my biggest headaches, so a repository with quotes,
images, FAQ's, background video, etc would be a great way to control
that message.

I don't know where we landed on how we will support application
development, but we should settle on how much support we can provide for
mesh application development and support before we put a ""develop apps""
page on the top bar.

For those just joining in, the issue in question is how to present usage
warnings related to Commotion's current capabilities[1] in a way that
does not imply that the user has misconfigured the software.

On one hand, we need to be very clear about Commotion's current
capabilities, especially given the press around the project. On the
other hand, we don't want to give the impression that a correct
installation has failed somehow.

If someone is concerned about their security, they will likely take note

If so, and if those other firmware distros are likewise capable of doing

not serving its intended purpose, and intimidating would-be users.

Boilerplate about ""no warranty given or implied / no liability for damage""

79,Commotion-discuss," Website feedback from hackday on ""warning""","Wed, 12 Jun 2013 14:54:17 -0400",-0400,Andrew Reynolds,"Probably, but this warning label is a direct result of Commotion's
billing as a circumvention tool, and specifically the representations of
Commotion's capabilities in the press.

We have a lot of features on the roadmap that aren't implemented yet,
some of which would be bad to get wrong.

80,Commotion-discuss," Website feedback from hackday on ""warning""","Wed, 12 Jun 2013 15:09:32 -0400",-0400,Seamus Tuohy,"Commotion has been publicly advertised as a security and circumvention
tool. A warning that can be disregarded, or examines Commotions security
in terms of liability, or from the perspective of it simply as router
firmware disregards the social realities surrounding the tool.

The Commotion warning label is an intervention. It uses global standards
for warning construction that were researched to cause exactly the
reaction we are seeing. This includes placement, size, color, and
language. Because it follows global standards users understand that it
is important and read the contents.

I would argue that it does in fact help a user navigate the risks since
each warning is directly linked to an overview of the risk and tools
that the user can use instead, or on top of commotion, in order to
address risks that they are concerned about.

https://commotionwireless.net/understanding-commotions-warning-label#internet


Wireless risks and security are very rarely understood, let alone mesh
security and risks. With our placement as ""circumvention technology"" in
the public we have a responsibility to educate any possible user on the
current state of the Commotion platform for circumvention and security.

Camouflaging the warning label below the fold, or in a color scheme that
is not immediately understood as a warning is in my opinion dishonest.
Until public opinion matches the current capabilities and safe use cases
of the Commotion platform I think that this intervention is the only
morally correct option. Safety should always trump style and comfort.

and all of the work you have put into the warning label.

Also - I don't think we should make any massive changes without looking at
some data. My initial suggestion was to explore some options, for us to
consider. It would also make sense to look at some data. The handful of
feedback from the hackday, is simply that, a handful. It'd be good to look
at how many people click on the links Seamus is referring to as well as
downloads and how many people land on the page and don't download.

Along the lines of these questions, do we have piwik setup and working? Or
is that still being fixed?

Another aspect to consider for when we are doing trainings is to approach
the downloading of the router image step differently. Especially in the
classroom setting it might make more sense to have the files ready for use
(on USB or local storage), rather than being dependent on access to the
commotion website. One challenge I've noticed when we've done this in Red
Hook (and at hackdays) is that we then put ourselves in a situation where
everyone is downloading the same file at the same time, over somewhat
limited networks the users/trainees and have a generally slow experience.

I vote - let's look at the data, decide the priority of this within the
website overhaul, and think about what it means in the training context.

86,Commotion-discuss, Material for a workshop on mesh networks,"Wed, 19 Jun 2013 14:27:55 +0400",+0400,Alexander Chemeris,"Hi all,

Is there any good source of materials to run a workshop about DIY mesh
networks? Software to use, slides to show about the theory of
operation?

I've been approached by guys from Moscow ""Strelka"" institute [1] about
running a workshop about DIY WiFi mesh networks and I'm looking for a
way to make it happen. Guys are engaged into volunteer crisis response
activities and a general DIY.

1. http://www.strelka.com/?lang=en

I'm trying to find people in Moscow who have real life experience with
WiFi mesh networks, especially DIY ones, but without much result so
far. Unfortunately, mesh networks are not so popular in Russia (yet).
And since I have only theoretical understanding of concepts and no
real experience, I'm looking for an easy way to (1) have something up
and running and (2) find some presentation materials about various
WiFi mesh projects, technology itself, etc.

Hardware wise we have old Fon devices, I should have two MeshPotatos
somewhere and we might be able to get some Ubiquiti gear from a
friendly company. I'm also thinking about simply installing olsrd or
batmand on few laptops as an easy way to get something up and running.

All recommendations and pointers are very appreciated.

That would be great!
Tomorrow (Thurs) or the day after (Fri) morning your time / evening my
time would be ideal for me. What is your preferred date/time?

I'm available on IRC, Skype and Hangouts, whichever is easier for you.

I can confirm having encountered similar issues specifically repeater nodes
not correctly masq'ing AP traffic to the Internet, while gateway nodes do.
My own problems were encountered running both private APs and coovachilli
APs (as opposed to nodogsplash) on nodes running the WasabiNet firmware,
not Commotion-OpenWRT. However the firewall config is quite similar.

So, on repeater nodes I have the 'masq' option enabled for zones mesh, ap1,
and ap2 (i.e. public and private APs).  On gateway nodes, it seems that I
need to have 'masq' disabled for zones ap1 and ap2.

100,Commotion-discuss, MtP router network,"Thu, 1 Aug 2013 17:32:39 -0400",-0400,Preston Rhea,"Hey Bill,

Thanks for subscribing to commotion-discuss. CCing that list in this response.

Some of the messages I got from other implementers and OTIers suggest
that there is a bug in the splash screen for repeater, not gateway,
nodes. The developers are working on isolating it. Any data we can get
from our routers is good for them. I did try to go through the AP,
both with my phone and my laptop, and neither worked. Yet, all the
implementers - including me - can SSH in to their DR1.1 node and from
it ping out to the internet by the command line. So it's a splash
screen problem.

The settings did not carry over, I unchecked the ""keep settings""
button - a must-do at this stage since all features aren't static.

I personally know that the two routers on MtP street have DR1.1, and
mine has PR3 - all the others have PR 2.1. The main issue with
updating, other than making sure not to carry settings over, is that
the new versions turn on mesh encryption by default and don't turn on
the wireless interfaces by default when you first start them up. This
doesn't work well with implemented networks in Mount Pleasant, Red
Hook, Detroit, etc. since it's not always easy to get to where you can
connect to the nodes by Ethernet. So, Dan rolled a custom image that
keeps the wireless interfaces on when you update, which I used for
both MtP Street routers.

However since you can easily manage your own node I recommend that if
you want to update, you should do so - just make sure you don't turn
mesh encryption on for your node, since all the nodes in the network
have to have it on for it to work. Otherwise the devices won't mesh.
If you run QuickStart, it will automatically encrypt the mesh links,
so you can either run it and then turn mesh encryption off, or you can
just set up the node yourself through the admin interface.

I believe that the next version of Commotion, DR2, is due out at the
end of next month (correct me if I'm wrong team) - stay tuned and
we'll probably update all the routers with that at that time, and turn
on encryption.

Thanks for staying meshed,

Preston

It was a pleasure to join Commotion team several  months ago.
With your support I was able to implement a local mesh newtwork with
two routers (picostation), my  two Linux LapTops and Iphone.
I have also tested the capabiity of commotiont application portal by
installing either Tidepools and MediGrid.
Most of the time spent to play with the raspberry and after installing
MediaGrid.
Everything works.I tried to upload and share some music and the chat.

Based on this experience I have some questions.
a)How to make the Raspberry pi part of the Mesh?In my application I have
connected it to the AP as external device.
b)Is there any future for the integration of raspberry in the commotion network?

Last question.
c)My idea is to buy two Nanostations and to extend the range of my local mesh.
Any suggestion based on your experience?
To reach longer distances(1 to 2  miles)I would choose a 5Ghz (the power
limit in Italy is 1 W output power at 5Ghz).Much more less for Wifi(15dbm).
Thanks for your support and suggestions.

105,Commotion-discuss, Next step:extend the range of a local mesh,"Tue, 13 Aug 2013 16:56:38 -0400",-0400,Dan Staples,"Hi Luigi,

Glad to hear about all the successes!

I have made a mesh network from Raspberry Pis before (battery-powered,
even), so it's definitely possible. The main challenge is to pick a good
USB wireless adapter. I recommend the TP-Link TL-WN722N [1], since its
driver supports ad-hoc mode in recent Linux kernels.

Then, you install your Raspberry Pi operating system (I recommend
Raspbian), and configure the wireless adapter to be in ad-hoc mode with
the correct SSID,BSSID,channel, etc. This is done in
/etc/network/interfaces...if you need info on how to to that, I can give
you resources.

Then you can install and configure OLSRd on the Pi, so that it can mesh
with the other devices. For an olsrd config file, you can look at
/var/etc/olsrd.conf on one of your picostations for an example.

Let us know how that goes!

totally agree that main challenge is to pick up a good USB wireless.
I have bought (1 month ago) theTP-Link  TL_WN821N(V.2).The V.2(I found 
out later) is not in the Linux kernel. I had to install the firmware 
carl9170. Easy to make it works in managed mode.
Still not working in ad-hoc mode.Not sure if it is a problem of the 
firmware( it should work also in ad-hoc) or the /etc/network/interfaces  
and wpa_supplicant setting.
Assuming that TL_WN821N(v.2) works,could be helpful to have some info 
from you based on your experience.
After I'll buy the TP-Link TL-WN722N
Thanks.

USB wifi adapter compatibility is tricky for instances where you want the
radio to broadcast multiple SSIDs (i.e. adhoc signal and a local AP
signal).  To date, I've only been able to get this working on
TL-WN821N *v3*which uses the
*ath9k_htc* driver, not v2 which uses the carl9170 driver.  Likewise for
the TL-WN722N.  Even then, I had patch the ath9k_htc driver (patch for
OpenWRT included) to make the radio do multiple SSIDs.

On the other hand, if you are using the commotion-mesh-applet tool under a
compatible desktop GUI like GNOME or Mate, it will only start a single
adhoc interface, rather than multiple SSIDs.  The caveat, at when I last
tested that tool in March, was that it expected the USB wifi interface to
be named ""wlan0"" rather something else like ""wlan1.""

Could you respond with the OS and kernel versions on all machines involved,
i.e. your laptop and the rPI?  The USB wifi driver might also be a bit
stale, too.

The burners seem to love it, what with all that radical self-reliance and
so forth.

In normal use, this little guy snaps in between the stock POE injector
provided with the UBNT radio and the cat5 run. I believe it has the same
400MHz / mips32 embedded SoC as other UBNT M-series gear, and 32MB of RAM.
My guess is that it has 2dB on-board patch antenna, but I'm hoping that
de-popping 0ohm resistors makes the addition of an RP-SMA pigtail possible.

Looks like Ubiquiti is totally sneaking this under the radar.  Vendors
should start selling it hopefully in a month or two, although burners say
it can be purchased right now by creating an account at
reseller.streakwave.com.

The datasheet indicates it runs AirOS, which would suggest reflashing to
OpenWRT is possible.  I've yet to find any confirmation about that, though.

113,Commotion-discuss, Internet.org,"Wed, 21 Aug 2013 17:37:35 -0500",-0500,Ben West,"Private industry collusion towards self-serving goals is pretty common
place for the Internet these days.  (Boy, don't I sound jaded.)

The partners thus far disclosed: Facebook, Ericsson, MediaTek, Nokia,
Opera, and Qualcomm, are all content providers or device manufacturers, no
carriers.  This looks similar to the dichotomy observed here in the US in
the ""Net Neutrality"" debate, where you see traditional phone/cable carriers
like Time Warner, Verizon, AT&T, and Comcast spar with content providers or
device manufacturers like Google and Microsoft.

So, yes indeed, a possible outcome from this partnership could be an
ultra-low-cost Android tablet with heavily optimized versions of Chrome OS
/ Opera / Facebook Home, bundled with very cheap 4G/LTE service, and
finally polished off with a generous helping of spyware.  No doubt such a
device could become the introduction to the Internet for a billion people,
but I can't help but be wary about how mediated that Internet access would
be.

Also, nothing about the partnership suggests any willingness to seriously
engage any Open Source technology, in particular the conspicuous lack of
Canonical's Ubuntu Edge or a successor to the OLPC.

Most unsettling is Qualcomm's participation, since they own all Atheros IP
now.  Almost all of Commotion's success in mesh wifi (and likewise for
OpenWRT / Funkfeuer / Ninux) derives from the existence of the Open Source
ath9k driver.  Has anyone perhaps seen a roadmap PDF from Qualcomm /
Atheros indicating the intended successor to the ath9k chipset?

That is, these guys are getting pretty old:
http://wikidevi.com/wiki/Atheros

I'm curious about Open Source driver prospects for these devices:

I am currently looking for some examples of node naming conventions/systems so that a new person to wireless networking can easily get the idea. Also maybe examples of password creating conventions/systems, both for Admin and for APs.

Over here, we often abbreviate street names (== the location of the node) and add the housenumber.
So for example, 57 Georgia Ave NW would become: 57gavNW
That's easy enough for people to construct the name in their heads but ""crypto"" enough so that other people do not automatically know what it means. We also sometimes use node names as ESSIDs and as fully qualified hostnames in DNS. 

Not saying this is the best approach, but it works. People remember the domain names of nodes.

Concerning Password creating schemas: https://xkcd.com/936/
(and might want to add some characters inbetween the spaces). 
Do *not* use anything less than 12 characters. Seriously.
That video from Defcon 2011 pretty much nailed it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFU-BS4ZZMw

Today I got updated myself on this topic (thx Ars Technica): http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/08/thereisnofatebutwhatwemake-turbo-charged-cracking-comes-to-long-passwords/

Kind of sucks when you tell people to use really long passwords based on dictionary words. They might really just use a quote from their favorite book (H.P. Lovecraft or bible, each to one's liking) and end up with in fact weak passwords.

So, I still stand by my ""and add some (random) characters between the spaces of words"" but better to use something stronger.

GPU cracking is making is just too easy...
Just imagine what a botnet of GPUs can do.

Sorry, had to correct my previous post.

Also, do NOT use spaces, as (at least with PR3) this caused seriously
problems and the node would have to be reset through direct connection
and not wirelessly. Which is frustrating for already deployed nodes.

Here's a quick resource on rooting:

Perhaps Will Hawkins can reply, but I believe the new version of 
Commotion-Android he's working on doesn't require root access anymore.

I apologize if I have overlooked the firmware somewhere. But, I stumbled upon commotion and really want to try it out. I have 4 picostation2 hp's and would like to try out commotion before purchasing the new picostations.  I am on a volunteer fire department and we want to try and set up something at our firehouse and neighborhood. 
Does anyone have a picostation 2 HP firmware?

131,Commotion-discuss, Pico's dropping signals in DR2,"Thu, 3 Oct 2013 06:15:24 -0400",-0400,Daniel Hastings,"Howdy Commotion Community,

I?ve been having problems with one of my nodes labeled Computer-Lab. I do
not think I experienced these problems until I upgraded to DR2. The
computer-lab is configured to mesh through Ethernet but also has meshed
with the outdoor node training-center.

During the last few days during class while students were using the network
I tried to download a file from the FP server.  Download speeds where very
high but halfway through during the download the computer-lab node
disconnected every students computer and lost the signal from the
computer-lab.  About 20 seconds later we were able to re-connect to the
computer-lab again.  The same thing also happened when I tried downloading
a file from the internet as well at another separate time.  I've also heard
from students that they have experienced the same problem with some of the
other nodes where all of the signal suddenly dropped and then returned 30
seconds later.

Also, this morning when I tried to connect to the Internet in the computer
lab I did not receive the splash screen or connect to the net even though
once I logged into the router could see that I was successfully meshed and
could ping the default gateway from the router without an issue.

The same problem happened two days ago with my central-tower node.

I know that near one of the nodes we have a cable TV coming into the school
via an antennae which may operate on a similar frequency because the
students cannot watch TV when the node that is closest to the antenna is
plugged in.  However, the antenna for the TV is not always plugged in so
when I had the other issues with the signal dropping during the day the TV
definitely did not have power.


Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks

Are you able to see if the router is rebooting during those periods

seeing some DR2 reboot problems here with the network we set up for a

this as soon as possible.

I'm not sure about the problem where you can't connect to the internet 
or get the splash page. Maybe could you give us the debug output the 
next time that happens? It's under the Commotion menu from the web 
admin interface.

Ben, could speak to any expectations you've encountered from your insurance

your carrier indicated whether they tend to prefer clients only using
off-the-shelf tripods, brackets, lightning grounding units, etc, or if

I hope those of you in Berlin are all having a good time at IS4CWN. Wish I
could join you.  Before I got into detail about my issue, I want to say we
have 4 nodes meshed now and have a very strong Student Network thanks to
Commotion. See image below:

[image: Inline image 1]

The screens shot is taken from the Computer-Lab node which also acts as a
gateway. Even though not labeled the central-tower acts as a gateway as
well.

As for my main concern, I?m having problems my Computer-Lab node. I do not
think I experienced these problems until I upgraded to DR2. The
computer-lab is configured to mesh through Ethernet but also has meshed
with the outdoor node training-center.

During the last few days during class while students were using the network
I tried to download a file from the ftp server.  Download speeds where very
high but halfway through during the download the computer-lab node
disconnected every students computer and mine from the computer-lab.  About
20 seconds later we were able to re-connect to the computer-lab again.  The
same thing also happened when I tried downloading a file from the internet
as well at another separate time.

Also, this morning when I tried to connect to the internet in the computer
lab I did not receive the splash screen or connect to the net even though
once I logged into the router could see that I was successfully meshed and
could ping the default gateway from the router without an issue.

The same problem happened two days ago with my central-tower node.

The router that the central-tower and computer-lab are connected to that
acts as a gateway is using DD-WRT, would this cause any issues?  Also the
computer lab and the training center nodes and girls-dorms nodes are all on
the same subnet of 101.108.214.1/24 This shouldn't cause a problem should
it? If it does how can I change AP's network?

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks

Can you give a little more detail about the DNS issue? What was it set
to, and how did you find out? Usually one's computer will set its DNS
server to the one(s) specified by the router, which is sent in the DHCP
response. So unless you manually configured the DNS servers your
computer uses, it should be using the router itself as the DNS server.

And what was the strange splash page behavior you experienced?

node to register you as authenticated than it does to redirect you, and
thus it splashes you again. In other words, you'll have to click through
the splash page 2 or 3 times before you actually get redirected to where

If you encounter it again, try clicking through a couple more times, and

Commotion comes with a few default profiles (defaultMesh, defaultAP,
etc). But once you go through the QuickStart, the node creates and
starts using another set of profiles: quickstartPlug, quickstartMesh,
quickstartAP, quickstartSec (or something similar). So those are the
profiles you will want to change.

When I get into the office today I'll take a look at the web interface

158,Commotion-discuss, DR2 Memory Issues Is there a Quick Fix?,"Mon, 21 Oct 2013 11:43:21 -0500",-0500,Ben West,"Here is a comment I added to a recent github issue re: node memory
consumption and serval, suggesting enabling compressed swap as a
psuedo-workaround.

https://github.com/opentechinstitute/commotion-openwrt/issues/40#issuecomment-25683085

... I suggested adding the ""zram-swap"" package presently in OpenWRT trunk
to the commotion packages feed, and then enabling swap in kernelconfig.
This would let you enable compressed swap memory on nodes, and ideally make
the memory limit somewhat softer (i.e. help nodes avoid OOM errors and
processes crashing).

So, specifically, do make kernel_menuconfig and make these selections:
General Setup -> Support for paging of anonymous memory (swap) *
Device Drivers -> Staging drivers -> Compressed RAM block device support *

This kernel config change can also be done via a patch, and such a patch is
buried somewhere in openwrt-devel listserv archives (i.e. when the zram
package was originally announced).

Then copy the zram_swap package from trunk into commotionfeed and enable it.

For my nodes with 32MB of RAM, I specify 6MB swap in /etc/config/system:

config system
    ...
    option 'zram_size_mb' '6'

You can periodically check swap usage to ensure nothing is using excessive
RAM:

root at nsm5-b:~# free
             total         used         free       shared      buffers
Mem:         29184        24100         5084            0         2752
-/+ buffers:              21348         7836
Swap:         6140            0         6140

I should note this is only a *pseudo-workaround*, as it does not address
the underlying issue of excessive RAM consumption.  At best, zrap-swap
would allow the node to avoid OOM errors, and furthermore detect it is in a
low-memory state and actively do something about it (e.g. reboot).

I am running zram-swap as described above on WasabiNet nodes, both 5.8GHz
mesh backhaul and 2.4GHz mesh APs, and I can confirm that certain processes
*do not like to be swapped out*, freezing or behaving erratically as a
result.  hostapd, wpa_supplicant, olsrd, crond/busybox, and whatever your
captive portal agent is (nodogsplash or coovachilli), all certainly
shouldn't be swapped out.  Possibly commotiond too, although I've not had
opportunity to test that.

So, the zram_swap method described above lacks a bit in robustness.  I
think the *mlock* command can be used to prevent specific processes from
being swapped out, although I'm uncertain of whether OpenWRT has this tool
integrated.

https://openitp.org/mesh-networks/trevor-ellermann-on-mesh-networks.html

I am curious to know the argument some of you pro-mesh people out there
might have against Trevor's argument of Mesh networks are not the most
suitable network infrastructure for the developing world.

He seems to think that mesh is good in places where it can be constantly
maintained.  I would argue that in our situation since we are not a large
network (4-6 nodes) maintenance is not as much of an issue.

However, I can certainly understand his argument .  We do have one node
that is not the easiest to reach (in a guard tower which means a lot of
climbing and trying not wake sleeping guards) but for remote regions with
many different nodes in a variety of locations troubleshooting may be a
problem.

He also mentions the issue of power.  I've always wanted to play with the
idea of solar powering a pico station. Has anyone seen this been done
before? We have plenty of sun in Africa and far too many unreliable
generators.

I am really intrigued to hear opinions about this argument especially of
those who have worked with both types of networks or certainly have more
knowledge on the subject.

I actually had the good fortune of having a few conversations with
Trevor after that article went live. While I will comment more below I
think it really comes down to the deployment model, and the current
state of networking education.

Trevor has worked extensively with communities to provide internet
connectivity with limited overall access to unfiltered/any internet and
to train the individuals there on how to maintain those networks. As
such, if any part of the network goes down it is easy to pinpoint the
problem. This makes it far easier to manage a network for a user who
only has the basic networking knowledge taught to them (having spoken to
Trevor I believe that it was surely a very high quality and
comprehensive set of training they received). It also means that if the
network manager is not around to, or is unwilling to provide
connectivity to other surrounding areas those areas have no choice but
to find a ""Trevor"" to assist them, or go without.

He is right in many ways, but I personally believe that the challenge we
must take on is to make the construction, management, and diagnosis of
mesh networks more easily understood and taken on by individuals so that
the network can easily spread where it is needed. I think that
optimizing a network for performance should also includes creating
community guidelines about usage and educating members on how to
identify the health of their part of the network and tune their node
accordingly. But, that still requires far, far, clearer, more powerful
tools and much more education material to make possible. That is what we
are doing with the Commotion project.

Really, my argument is not a disagreement with the thoughts Trevor has.
It is a completely different intervention style based upon capacity and
the power of the network-manager. This planet has yet to see capable
individuals flocking to provide connectivity to those in need. It is far
too profitable to control avenues of communication, and far to hard to
gain the expertise and time needed to build and maintain networks at
large scale (though luckily it is getting cheaper to do). There are
groups of amazing technologists, like Trevor, who are doing amazing work
providing managed networks and the education to maintain them.  But, the
disparity is to great, and the locations to many to have people like
Trevor go out to all the communities that need him.

For these, and many other reasons, we have focused on developing tools
and educational materials that allow a community to assess their needs
and create the basic connectivity that they are lacking. We feel that
when a Trevor is not available, mesh networking has the best chance for
providing an infrastructure that will be able to grow as a community
needs it to grow. (I keep saying me because I have picked up much of
this philosophy from other members of OTI and the Commotion team, but I
should point out again that this quick overview only represents my
personal views on this project.)

Maintenance is such a hard problem for long standing networks. Simply
looking at the node-maps of various community wireless projects with an
eye to the version field of unconnected nodes will show dozens, if not
hundreds, of forgotten, unreachable, or otherwise unmaintainable nodes.
I have heard from many that it is just not worth the time unless they
start interfering with the network. Some of these projects are mesh,
some are managed. A house changes ownership or a store changes
management and all of a sudden a roof is off limits or an ethernet cable
unplugged without any real recourse. I think that funkfeuer and guifi
might actually have people sign contracts when they offer their roof for
usage to have some legal looking paper to hopefully convince the new
owners to at least let them reclaim the hardware.

But all that is to say that maintainance is both a hardware/software
problem, as well as a education and community engagement problem. The
Commotion project has put out, and is continuing to develop a good deal
of materials on both the actual mounting of a node
https://commotionwireless.net/docs/cck/building-mounting/prep-install-rooftop-nodes
but, also in the outreach and planning stages that will allow
communities to build the human infrastructure that will support
long-term maintenance. It is a much harder lift but, by documenting
working community models for maintaining communications infrastructure
over time it creates a more resilient human network to support a
deployed network. https://commotionwireless.net/docs/cck (keep an eye
out for the next set of planning guides which will have more of this
focus in them.)

There was a person at IS4CWN who was doing power measurements on a
pico-station to make buying the right solar panel/batteries easier.  I
am almost sure I have seen it working before as well. The Southern
California Tribal Digita Village
(http://www.newamerica.net/files/New_Media_Technology_and_Internet_Use_in_Indian_Country.pdf)
runs 5 backbone nodes on mountain-tops off of solar arrays. It is a much
more solid infrastructure, but something to look to for large long-term
solar networks.

161,Commotion-discuss, Mesh Networks vs Spoke Hub-Spoke Networks,"Wed, 23 Oct 2013 18:27:11 -0500",-0500,Ben West,"Hi All,

I also had the fortune to chat with Trevor about his adventures in distant
lands, and yes, we ended up more or less agreeing on each others' opinions
of mesh topology vs. more traditional hub & spoke networks.  Indeed, I'm
keen on wireless meshes, but specifically on partitioned meshes that span
multiple channels and/or bands to ensure realistic bandwidth availability.
Trevor has a strong need to set up reliable networks quickly, using
available, off-the-shelf equipment, with handy documentation.

The IS4CWN summits, and the community mesh movement at large, have made
fantastic progress towards this end, but there is still work to do to win
over the Trevors and the Matt Rantanens of the world that they can find
benefit in using mesh.  From a high level, promoting interoperability
between different meshing schemes, a al the goals of the Interop group at
http://interop.wlan-si.net/ would definitely help reduce the learning curve
for mesh.  Also, the fact that Trevor came to speak at the summit shows
this progress is under way.

As for solar power, it was Danny Iland from USCB who gave a presentation in
Berlin about hyper-precise power measurements and solar / battery size
estimation.  If you don't have it, I can share Danny's email address
off-list (in consideration of privacy).

162,Commotion-discuss, Mesh Networks vs Spoke Hub-Spoke Networks,"Thu, 24 Oct 2013 21:45:13 -0400",-0400,Joshua Breitbart,"To this great discussion, I'll add one slightly more obscure point: In
my experience speaking with people who have next to no experience with
wireless networking, there's something about mesh that makes intuitive
sense. I think it's that the flexibility makes it easier to align with
the social networks we experience in our daily lives.

If you tell people there will be one leader and anyone who wants to say
anything to anyone else has to pass a message through the leader, that
doesn't sound very appealing. On the other hand, if you say that anyone
can speak to anyone else as long as we take turns, can see each other,
and don't talk too loudly, that seems right.

So, yes, mesh networking has some added technical overhead, but as a
digital expression of the world we want, it's a lot more appealing than
hub-and-spoke.

165,Commotion-discuss, Certificate Warnings,"Mon, 28 Oct 2013 10:31:31 -0400",-0400,Dan Staples,"Hi Dan,

When a browser sees a self-signed or unknown certificate, it will give
you a warning, then ask you to either accept it, or reject it. If you
accept it, by default it will save it *permanently*, which is likely
where your trouble comes from.

The first time you connected to 101.100.79.1, you probably accepted the
certificate, and so now your browser permanently associates that IP
address with that particular certificate at that time. If you have since
reflashed the node, that same IP address will now have a *different*
certificate, and your browser freaked out and won't let you proceed.

So the solution is first to remove the cached certificate associated
with that IP address from your browser, as you already did. After that,
you can either do the same thing every time you reflash the node, or you
can accept the certificate *temporarily* instead of permanently. Here's
a Firefox add-on I use that makes the default browser behavior to accept
certificates temporarily:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/y-u-no-validate/.

Regarding your certificate authority question, the certificates
presented by the nodes are self-signed, meaning they have no certificate
authority.

I hope this helps. If you have any other questions, let me know! Seamus
was working on documentation regarding the certificate warnings, so
maybe he has a section about how the browser caches them?

You might want to check out my project MediaGrid:
http://mediagrid.disman.tl/

It implements a decentralized, encrypted webchat service (as well as
file sharing), and was designed to run on Raspberry Pis in a mesh network.

It's decentralized in that each Pi (or whatever device running it) has a
database of messages that it continuously synchronizes with the other
devices on the mesh, constantly updating with new messages. You can also
do private messages to other users in the webchat, similar to IRC.

That is exactly what I am looking for.  The replicated database is

the Pis but still retain survivability if one or more of the devices gets
knocked out.  Any thoughts on using an Anycast routing scheme and multiple
instances of the CRM and map server to achieve this?  I'm I barking up the
wrong tree?

172,Commotion-discuss, Has anyone implemented serverless messaging,"Wed, 30 Oct 2013 09:13:57 -0400",-0400,Dan Staples,"It depends on how you want to access it, I suppose. If not every node is
running the GIS & CRM servers, then anycast could theoretically work
well, as long as the servers again are in sync. Personally, I don't have
any experience using anycast for fallback support.

What I designed MediaGrid to do was to have each instance advertise
itself on the mesh using multicast DNS. That way, each node collects a
list of all the other nodes running MediaGrid, and starts bi-directional
synchronization with each of them. CouchDB makes this synchronization
super easy and hands off, which is why I use it for the back end. Here's
a script that does the automatic peer discovery and synchronization, in
case it's helpful for your GIS & CRM server idea:

I imagine you could also just host all of the GIS and CRM files in couchDB
as well, potentially in the form of a couchapp (
http://couchapp.org/page/index) and work with Leaflet as the front end for
the map.

We were thinking about this idea for Tidepools (tidepools.co), which is
currently uses MongoDB, but could be restructured to work on top of couchDB.

Also re:GIS... Vector maps are much smaller and easier to store, so you
might opt for Vector over raster map data if you are working on the RPi.

Dan Geer: http://geer.tinho.net/geer.suitsandspooks.8ii12.txt.

The talk is pretty broad and waxes philosophical, but it brings up some
interesting points about increasing attack surfaces (especially with
proliferating embedded systems), automation, and the ability of humans
to manage the security of increasingly interdependent networks. Some of
this we can apply to Commotion:


""So should or should not an embedded system have a remote management
interface?  If it does not, then a late discovered flaw cannot be
fixed without visiting all the embedded systems which is likely to
be infeasible both because some will be where you cannot again go
and there will be too many of them anyway.  If it does have a remote
management interface, the opponent of skill focuses on that and,
once a break is achieved, will use those self-same management
functions to ensure that not only does he retain control over the
long interval but, as well, you will be unlikely to know that he
is there.

Perhaps what is needed is for at least some computers to be more
like humans, and I most assuredly do not mean artificially intelligent.
By ""more like humans"" I mean this: Embedded systems, if having no
remote management interface and thus out of reach, are a life form
and as the purpose of life is to end, an embedded system without a
remote management interface must be so designed as to be certain
to die no later than some fixed time.  Conversely, an embedded
system with a remote management interface must be sufficiently
self-protecting that it is capable of refusing a command.  Inevitable
death and purposive resistance are two aspects of the human condition
we need to replicate, not somehow imagine that to overcome them is
to make an improvement.""


I know for a fact there are Commotion networks and nodes out there that
have been abandoned, are using wildly out of date firmware, but are
probably still reachable in public spaces. What is our responsibility to
those devices (can I allude to Shelley's Frankenstein here?)? Certainly
the end-user has the freedom to setup and modify their Commotion devices
however they want, but would it be wise, security-wise, for us to
implement by default some sort of end-of-life mechanism for nodes that
aren't actively maintained or managed through a remote administration tool?

Just some food for thought...

Building a Mesh Network in Rural Somaliland
Published:  December 11, 2013

by Daniel Hastings

I had heard about mesh networking before I arrived in Somaliland, but
had never been in the position to actually build a mesh network. When I
accepted the position as ICT instructor at Abaarso School of Science and
Technology in Abaarso, Somaliland, I figured this may be my chance. I
knew that the Open Technology Institute (OTI) had been developing a mesh
firmware called Commotion, suitable for remote locations. Upon arriving
in Somaliland I decided that building a mesh network using Commotion
would be one of my top priorities.

It seemed like building a mesh network could be a difficult process. I
experimented in the past with other firmware on a variety of routers,
but found the configuration to be too time-consuming and difficult to
set up.
I knew Commotion ran on Ubiquti hardware, designed for rough outdoor
environments like Somaliland. Unfortunately, finding Ubiquti routers in
Somaliland -- for that matter, getting anything into Somaliland -- is no
easy task.

Somaliland is an independent autonomous region of Somalia, and is an
area that is safe compared to the southern regions of Somalia. While not
internationally recognized as a country, Somaliland has its own
currency, government, and military.

The analogy I like to use when it comes to traveling to Somaliland is no
different than that of getting to Hogwarts. Instead of running head
first into an imaginary platform at the train station, you have to land
in Dubai, catch a flight that leaves only once a week and then travel
across a desert on one of the worst-built roads you can imagine.

While back in the US this past summer I contacted OTI and found that
they would be able to provide me with the proper equipment to run and
set up a mesh network using Commotion. I was so excited about the
possibility of actually getting all of the equipment into Somaliland
that I carefully packed everything into my carry-on.

Before I go any further, I should explain my level of experience with
building networks. My only experience with networking had been taking a
class at a community college in San Francisco and spending the last year
troubleshooting our Internet problems at school. However, Commotion is
built in such a way that little if any advanced configuration is
necessary to set up a mesh network.

I first began building my network by identifying where I wanted access
points on campus and mapping out distances between each spot. Having a
good line of sight between each node was extremely important. Luckily we
have a lot of high guard and water towers on campus so placing nodes was
not an issue.

One minor problem with placing nodes in towers was that I had to ensure
a reliable power source was within range of the node. If all my nodes
were solar-powered, I would not have had to worry about running any
cable at all!

I next had to ?flash? each router, which means loading the Commotion
firmware on to each Ubiquti device. I had experience flashing firmware
onto routers before but had never ?meshed? wireless nodes together. To
help with this I referred to the configuration examples on Commotion?s
website, which I found extremely helpful. Open source software has been
known to be tricky to configure and maintain but it certainly does not
have to be. Commotion has proved this to be more than true.

While building the network, I made sure to include students as much as I
could. I assembled together a computer club of my top ICT students to
discuss and teach the basics of mesh networking, how to flash firmware
onto routers, and how to add a node to the network. Together we ran
cable and climbed water towers to place the nodes in their proper
places. We also had to place some nodes in the guard towers which often
times, the guards would unplug accidentally. Students trained the guards
on the difference between the LAN and PoE ports as well as the
importance of keeping the PoE cable plugged in at all times. A few weeks
after school we put up the last two nodes for the girls? dorms and the
boys? dorms.

Local Applications and Limited Bandwidth

Somaliland is currently the only country in Africa that lacks fiber
optic access -- cables are laid but access is not predicted to be
available until 2014. Somaliland receives its Internet connection via
microwaves across the desert from Djibouti. All of the IP address ranges
in Somaliland will tell you that you are in Djibouti. The distant
gateway connectivity, not to mention unreliable ISPs, equates to some
seriously slow Internet.

A lack of consistent access to the Internet is an ICT instructor?s
nightmare. Not being able to teach the most current technologies can be
frustrating, and it also hampers sharing files with students.
Mesh networking is described as a ?peer to peer network:? I wanted to
use the full sense of the term and make file sharing among my students
easy and manageable. In order to solve this communication problem I
decided to rely less on the outside Internet and rely more on local
applications installed on our servers.

I found the solution to our inconsistent and slow Internet by installing
OwnCloud, an open source alternative to Dropbox, on our local server.
Now students could share homework assignments with me and other teachers
without having to rely on the Internet at all.

Creating a Self-Sufficient Network

As well as the network worked and as much fun as setting it up was, I
cannot call this project successful until I can come back to Somaliland
a year from now and see the same nodes in place running the same network.
I used a few methods to make sure this would be the case. I was careful
to document every aspect of the project and create detailed guides for
teachers and future network administrators on everything from how to
find your IP address on the network to how to ping a node, which is
important for isolating a potential problem on the network. Even though
mesh networks are ?self-healing?, they are not perfect and still have
their quirks.

Having all of the knowledge centered in one place with one staff member
will only set an organization up for failure, so I've made sure to give
a series of small trainings to the entire staff.

The more transparent you are about how the network works, the more
likely the technology will last.

I repeatedly told my students that some of the greatest makers and
technologists of our time were self-taught. The excellent support
community centered around open source software makes projects such as
Commotion sustainable. There is a good chance that if a problem arises,
someone else already had that issue or someone in another community
across the globe is working on a solution to that problem.

I would like to give my sincere gratitude to the Commotion Wireless
Project for the support they gave me along with providing me with
necessary tools to build this network. Not only did the students at
Abaarso School get extremely enthused about mesh networking and learn
the meaning of community technology, but now another small part of a
country that, technically, does not even exist is more connected to the
rest of the world.

I tested commotion 1.0 with Andy Gunn when he was in town and we installed
commotion
on one Nanostation and one Picostation. After the initial install commotion
worked well but as soon as one was rebooted they quit meshing with each
other.

We re-flashed the routers and got the same result the second time as well.

I believe Andy put in a Bug fix request with the developers but I wondered
if you knew when the next build would be ready to go or if there was a work
around? We can't deploy the new version if it is broken. I've been
monitoring the commotion email groups and surprisingly no-one has mentioned
this issue.

We are also teaching a new batch of digital stewards so I am hoping it
might get fixed before we get to router flashing part of the curriculum.

Good luck to you all and thanks for all of your help!

We also noticed the bug you are talking about, and there was a recent

Andy's bug report is here, and could probably be closed out:

Regarding a new version, we are planning to push out version 1.1 by the
end of the month, which will contain a number of bug fixes. When does
the flashing section of the Digital Stewards training start?

Thanks for bringing this up!

The DR2 Nano on top of AMP goes down/loses the gateway almost weekly and I

Currently we usually look at the viz for a quick snapshot of the network
health.

When we are looking to see if a link works, or if a node is online we
turn it on and scan for that link or node. When we have a problem we
turn on the viz and look for the color of the link to see if it is a
routing problem.

We often compare viz data with ping tests to the services/internet that
we are trying to reach through those nodes.

The colored lines, node names, and different icons for gateways vs.
non-gateway nodes are really useful for getting an at-a-glance view of
the network. Though, we would like solid lines and the nodes to be solid
colors so it is easier to identify things at a glance.

We HATE the auto-sort jitter/movement of the current viz. It means that
we have to spend time clicking and dragging nodes back on screen to see
what the network looks like.  The ETX value is also confusing to new
node administrators Since it is on a scale of [1-5/infinity]. It should
probably be replaced by another value on a scale of 0-100% or some other
scale that makes sense to people who don't have OLSR's link quality
algorithm memorized.

If you all could get a dump of debug info (look for the debug menu in

greatly help us improve Commotion and fix whatever problems are causing

195,Commotion-discuss, A Business Model for Neighborhood Wireless,"Tue, 1 Apr 2014 09:51:47 -0500",-0500,Ben West,"HI Matt,

As an operator of a small, mesh-based micro-WISP in St. Louis which
supports itself (barely) using a Freemium model, thank you for sharing
this.  Off-hand, I can offer these comments.

- The biggest factor to establishing a WISP, clearly, would be who is your
upstream ISP.  It's fair to assume cable and DSL providers won't sell to
you, leaving fiber.  Depending on the availability of lower cost aerial
fiber (it's not available in St. Louis, for example), your uplink may
likely cost single-digit $1000's per month.  Cheaper, i.e. below $2000/mo,
can be done if you have a relationship with a nearby data house who is
willing let you mount something like UBNT AirFiber on their roof
inexpensively for your backhaul.  But don't see surprised by expectations
of ~$1000/mo roof rights.

- The figures for subscriber equipment (i.e. the CPE) and installation
labor are spot on.  I'd recommend adding whatever fractional of the ISP
cost for each subscriber to better gauge the business' sustainability.
E.g. $2000/mo uplink cost spread across 100 subscribers = $20/mo raw ISP
cost per subscriber.

- I would also recommend adding a line item to your spreadsheet for some
3rd party portal / payment handling service like
GateSpot<http://store.wisp-router.com/GateSpot>,
e.g. invoice generation, credit card processing, etc.  It is possible to
run your own portal and payment gateway via freeRADIUS / Drupal / Ubercart
/ Paypal / Dwolla / etc, but there's a steep learning curve.

- I'd also recommend making an estimate on subscriber attrition / loyalty.
Not everyone is going to pay their subscription fee, and your small
business' ability to follow-up with each and every person who falls behind
is very finite.  Estimating, for example, 15% non-paying subscribers as
part of normal operation (and scaling expected revenue to cover that gap),
could allow for much more efficient operation.

- Insurance for installed equipment is a good idea, especially if this
business is otherwise unable to roll trucks to repair damage after a large
wind storm.  For example, a previous list member mentioned getting $1M
liability on their rooftop gear for $425 annual premium from this carrier:
http://www.techinsurance.com/default10.aspx

- In an urban environment, using mesh transport over 2.4GHz is just not
going to work reliably beyond the scale of a single block or so.  This is
made ever more frustrating by the proliferation of consumer WiFi routers
that hop channels (especially those distributed by the millions by the
cable company), ensuring there will never be a consistently free channel.
I can confirm this from operating UBNT Nano M2s that have difficulty
maintaining adequate signal just down a single neighborhood block, despite
both units being shielded with RF Armor.  Also, there isn't really a good
solution yet for meshes to channel hop reliably, although someone will be
making a presentation about draft implementation at this year's Battlemesh.

- Pretty much all WISPs, along with some of the larger mesh network
operators on this list (myself included), thus use 5.8GHz for backhaul over
distances greater than a block.  However, this band is also getting much
much noisier, and I'm expecting the noise level that renders the 2.4GHz
band largely unusable for me here in St. Louis to transition over to 5.8GHz
in a couple years.  (Thanks again, in part, to the cable company who is
selling dual-band WiFi routers preprogrammed for full TX power to every new
subscriber.)  Non-meshing WISPs are gradually switching their backhaul
operations over to the DFS bands, which require active radar detection for
legal operation.  That same Battlemesh presentation mentioned above will be
for a draft Open Source implementation for DFS compliance, but to my
knowledge, no FCC-approved option exists yet for running adhoc over DFS
channels.

- Finally, White Space, or TVWS, is clearly an intriguing option for
wider-spaced rural areas (although still very pricey, ~$10k).
Unfortunately, my understanding is that can not handle the typical user
density for urban areas.

In my experience, when I'm connected to a gateway node, it shows itself

haven't paid attention enough to confirm this, but it just seems to be a
limitation of the way OLSRd reports HNAs/gateways in its txtinfo and

There are definitely plans to replace OLSR-Viz with something much
better, comparable to what other projects like Freifunk and AlterMundi
use, but I can't really say how far off that is.

The gateway flag in the current olsr-viz simply looks for a host network
announcement of ""0.0.0.0"" from a node. I don't know if smart-gateway
impacts how the node collects HNA's from other devices when a node is
already a gateway.

I will add this to my notes on the new OLSR-Viz rewrite for clients. I
am planning to compile the feedback from the lists into a draft spec of
the new OLSR-Viz and sending it back to the lists in a couple of weeks
for a final round of feedback.

Thanks! Getting these kinds of issues identified when we are still in

don't effect users after the actual release.

I flashed a router with Version 1.1rc1 and could not reproduce the issue
you described.

I opened a issue for this on our github
https://github.com/opentechinstitute/luci-commotion-splash/issues/28 . I
would appreciate it  greatly if you could review the steps I followed
and let me know what I did differently so I can better evaluate how to
reproduce the issue you saw.

Knowing the router you used will be a big help here. Also, if you can
run the commotion-debugger on your 1.0 build and send that to me
(directly and not on the list) I can update a router from exactly your
configuration to triangulate what the issue is.

Thanks for bringing this to our attention. I hope we can figure out what
the problem is.

what Net Neutrality advocates had been pressing for.  It is not ""neutral.""

That said, ISPs are correct in that delivering copious amounts of streaming
content from Netflix, Hulu, etc to their subscribers do indeed incur them a
large cost to transport specifically that content, so they have motivation
to recoup those costs via higher usage fees or by charging Netflix, Hulu,
etc. directly.  Nevertheless, it is illuminating to re-parse the ISPs'
argument that, yes, they do indeed sell their subscribers access to the
entire Internet, but that service now would no longer include the
expectation of fast access to certain content providers (e.g. Netflix,
Hulu) who don't already have some ""fast-lane"" arrangement with the ISPs.

So, the ISPs are hoping the FCC officially greenlights their desire to
offer tiered access to the Internet, based on whatever terms the ISPs
choose to set, whether justified by actual operational costs of delivering
streaming content, or just simply arbitrary.

My personal opinion, for the sake of elegance, is that 5Mbit/s, 10Mbit/s,
20Mbit/s or whatever speed access to the Internet should be access at that
speed to the entire Internet.  If lots of ISP subscribers want fast access
to Netflix's servers, for example, that should simply be a cost of doing
business for that ISP, who would then be free to recoup that cost by
raising their rates, streamlining their internal operation for faster
transport, etc.  Indeed, competing ISPs may be able to offer sufficiently
fast access to Netflix for lower rates, and if so, that's perfectly fine.
The market would be a level playing field.

The ""Fast Lane"" is *not* a level playing field.  It permits the largest
ISPs to collude over what content they chose to offer at useful speeds, and
it reduces their motivation to make system-wide upgrades or improvements
for increased bandwidth for everyone.

220,Commotion-discuss, distribution of load among gateways and,"Sun, 01 Jun 2014 21:34:38 -0400",-0400,Josh King,"Hi John,

We definitely intend to add OLSRv2 as an option soon, though we also
intend to continue to support OLSRv1 until or unless it is completely
superseded. However, the question of whether it would do what you want
is complex, as there are at least three different factors at play.

The first, which is: can OLSR take gateway bandwidth into account when
it selects a gateway? This is actually something that OLSRv1 can do,
though we don't enable it by default as it's relatively new and fairly
complex. OLSRv1 has SmartGateway, which we enable by default and which
uses IP-over-IP tunnels in order to select and use gateways in such a
way that it helps to avoid breaking connections when a new gateway
becomes 'closer' (you have a better path to it) than your old gateway.
SmartGateway also provides parameters that are disabled by default for
tuning whether the capacity of the gateway is taken into account when
selecting which gateway to use (i.e., whether to sometimes use a fat
pipe that is further away than a thin pipe that is closer). However, the
values that a gateway advertises are not dynamic (OLSR has no inherent
way of 'knowing' how much bandwidth its upstream link has) so the values
it uses are upstream and downstream bandwidth parameters set manually in
the configuration file. So if you knew the speed of a particular
connection, you could set it manually in the config file and set every
other node in the network to take that into account when choosing a gateway.

Relatively recently, a plugin called sgdynspeed was added to OLSR. This
basically allow OLSR to periodically read a text file that contains
updated bandwidth values, and update what SmartGateway advertises for
that gateway accordingly. So what it would be possible to do is set up
some kind of automated bandwidth test that would write its results into
the text file, use sgdynspeed to read that text file and update OLSR's
values for that gateway, and have the other nodes in the network take
that into account when selecting a gateway. Thereby, you can allow for
your network to try and take which gateways are faster and which are
slower into account.

The second question is, what will OLSRv2 get you which will make this
work better? Now, I don't think that OLSRv2 actually has the
SmartGateway support described above ported to the new codebase yet
(though I'm not certain). However, what it does have is a better method
of choosing routes. OLSRv1 uses the ETX metric for deciding which links
to use in the network; ETX is basically just a measure of packet loss.
However, OLSRv2 by default uses an updated metric called ETT. ETT uses
not just packet loss, but link capacity as reported by the radio to
choose routes. ETT would, for instance, conceivably choose a 54Mbps link
with 10% packet loss over a 2Mbps link with 5% packet loss. So it won't
take faster gateways into account on its own, but it will more
accurately choose which gateway you have the best connection to.

The third question is, can you use more than one gateway at once in
order to multiplex uplink capacity? This question is a little more
complicated. The newest versions of SmartGateway (now dubbed
MultiSmartGateway) contain support for using multiple gateways at once.
However, to my understanding, this is designed to work in tandem with
another protocol called BRDP (Border Router Discovery Protocol). BRDP
basically sends information that allows each node to replace its default
route with a statistical table of available default routes.
Unfortunately, as far as I know, no practical implementation of BRDP yet
exists. If it ever does, however, OLSR is already set up to work with it
and would allow for multiple gateways to be used in tandem for a single
connection, dramatically increasing uplink capacity. This is an advanced
application of this capability, and would also need a network with full
IPv6 support as well as multi-path transport protocols like MP-TCP in
order to fully realize it. Also, without communicating to a host on the
internet that is also set up to make best use of it, this applies mostly
to the uplink and not the downlink; there isn't anything in standard
TCP/IP that makes a host aware of multiple return paths.

Anyway, sorry for the overly long explanation. The upshot is that
depending on what you want to do, some stuff is ready to go with OLSRv1
even if we don't turn it on by default, but other stuff may be a longer
way off than just upgrading to OLSRv2.

thanks for the explanation. a little above my pay grade but I think I understand.  Interesting stuff.
If I can figure out how to, maybe I'll experiment with the options in OLSRv1.  However, what I'm probably looking for is dynamic gateway selection or possibly what you call multiplex uplink capacity.  Those sound complicated and not likely to be implemented in the near future.

224,Commotion-discuss, distribution of load among gateways and,"Mon, 09 Jun 2014 14:56:11 -0400",-0400,Josh King,"Hey John, Dan,

No problem! SmartGateway has the following configuration parameters
pertaining to weighting by bandwidth:

SmartGatewayWeightExitLinkUp (controls whether to consider upload
bandwidth in gateway selection, default is 1)
SmartGatewayWeightExitLinkDown (controls whether to consider download
bandwidth in gateway selection, default is 1)
SmartGatewayWeightEtx (controls whether to consider ETX in gateway
selection, default is (obviously) 1)
SmartGatewayDividerEtx (controls how bandwidth and ETX are compared,
default is 0)

The recommended settings in the README suggest leaving the first 3
settings at one, and setting SmartGatewayDividerEtx to 4096 (if it's set
to zero, as it is by default, bandwidth is not taken into account and
only ETX is used). The README contains the formula for the calculation:

http://olsr.org/git/?p=olsrd.git;a=blob_plain;f=README-Olsr-Extensions;hb=HEAD

In general, the READMEs in the OLSRd git repository, both for the daemon
itself and for its plugins, are the best source of documentation for
specific configuration settings. OLSRd has been around for along while,
and thus a lot of other documentation you find around the internet is
out of date.

So using this knowledge, you'd set the upstream and downstream speed in
the OLSRd configuration file on your gateway node, and then configure
every other node in the network with SmartGatewayDividerEtx, which will
force OLSRd to take those bandwidth values into account. I haven't
tested this myself though, as we don't currently have an automated way
built into Commotion to test those values.

An understandable concern, for sure. I can say that OTI has every

As for modifying Commotion itself, it depends on what you'd like to
modify or change about it. Modifying the web interface, which is what
most users will interact with, requires knowledge of basic web design
(HTML, CSS, some javascript) and OpenWRT's LuCI framework
(http://luci.subsignal.org/) which is built in Lua.

Anything more substantial than that, I would recommend learning about
the internals of OpenWRT, which has substantial (though sometimes
outdated) documentation: http://wiki.openwrt.org/. For the
Commotion-specific components, you can check out the code on Github
(https://github.com/opentechinstitute) and documentation
(http://wiki.commotionwireless.net/).

Developing applications is much more open. Any applications you can
run over the internet or on a LAN can run on a Commotion network.
Websites, file-sharing, streaming radio, game servers, you name it.
Web applications (like MediaGrid) are probably the most common. As
long as you have a server connected to the mesh that has some sort of
application running, you can announce it using the Commotion apps
portal:
http://code.commotionwireless.net/projects/commotion/wiki/Application_Portal.

The largest deployed Commotion networks are in the US (Detroit and Red
Hook) and Tunisia (Sayada), and they would be good people to ask for
advice. Some of them are hopefully on this email list, which we're
encouraging to be a place for users and network builders to share
their experiences, and more info can be found here:

I'm afraid I don't know the plans for the next IS4CWN. But if we ever

These are all running DR2, right? You haven't upgraded them to version 1
yet?

The first thing that comes to mind is that it's a firewall issue. When a
Commotion router gets a DHCP lease for its ethernet interface from an
upstream router, it treats any connections over ethernet as coming from
the unsafe ""wan"" zone. Therefore, there is a firewall rule blocking
connections to the HTTPS admin web interface (though HTTP and SSH are
allowed).

To get around this, you could connect to the router's access point and
freely use the admin web interface, or you could, over ethernet, SSH
into the node and temporarily turn off the firewall with
`/etc/init.d/firewall stop` (or just add a firewall opening for port 443
in /etc/config/firewall and restart the firewall).

If that doesn't work, let us know!

232,Commotion-discuss, Commotion Wireless Fano(Italy),"Tue, 17 Jun 2014 16:03:22 -0400",-0400,Ryan Gerety,"Hey Luigi,

Since we have had some conversation off the list, I wanted to bring it  
back to the list....

As far as the initial steps of the networks--I think it varies quiet a  
bit. In Tunisia, the initial network was build over 4 days in a large  
community workshop that had about 10-15 core people and 20-30  
additional participants.  In that workshop they talked about what they  
wanted the network to do, where it would connect, etc. During the  
workshop the participants went through several of the Commotion  
Construction Kit activities (like http://commotionwireless.net/docs/cck/planning/design-your-network-every-network-tells-story/) 
. The group made a map of where they wanted to connect with the  
network and of rooftops they might have access to. I think a few core  
people is great, but a larger community meeting is important for  
getting more people involved and donate their rooftops.

In other places the process has been over a longer time frame, and  
groups will do one or two activities a week together. If you guys  
wanted to go that direction, I'd be happy to make some suggestions  
about how that could be structured. I'm sure others on the list would  
also have suggestions.

If you do go through the Commotion activities we would love to get  
pictures and blog about it.

Other community technology projects have been launched using a  
DiscoTech model, which is a fun way a community can engage with new  
technologies:
http://detroitdjc.org/2012/07/01/discotech-zine-out-now/

We also recently made a Digital Stewards facebook group, which will  
hopefully be a good resource on all the community network and digital  
stewardship projects: https://www.facebook.com/DigitalStewards?fref=nf

In terms of commitment to Commotion, I think the good thing about open  
source router firmware is that you arent locked into a single firmware  
or hardware. As new versions of openwrt mesh come out--you can try  
those too.

If you'd like help going through the installation process, I'm sure  
people would be willing to jump on a video call to do it together....

Cheers!
Ryan

233,Commotion-discuss, Can't get past luci admin page,"Wed, 18 Jun 2014 16:57:33 -0400",-0400,Andrew Jawitz,"Hello Again,
   So my meeting went well enough for me to start sharing some details
about our potential deployment in coastal Maine.  I have a lot of technical
questions that I'll post in a different thread, but I'll try to give some
background in this post.
   As the Co-Captain of Code for Maine, an affiliate of the Code for
America Brigade in Maine, I've found the potential for civic hacking in
rural regions is often blocked by a lack of adequate wireless
infrastructure.  I first encountered this problem when attempting to design
a low-cost, open source vehicle tracker
<http://www.openvehicletracker.org> for small
transit systems and municipal vehicle fleets such as snow plows.  3G
networks presented enormous problems, partially due to the wireless
carriers, but mostly because coverage in rural places is far from reliable.
 This is especially true in my current place of residence in South
Harpswell Maine, which is more or less a collection of long narrow
peninsulas extending deep into Casco Bay north of Portland.  Much of the
area, including the fire station, school and post office have no cell
coverage whatsoever.  As counter-intuitive as it may seem, Mesh Networking
emerged as a viable alternative for tracking public sector vehicle fleets
since nearly all use cases were confined to a fixed route or at least a
well-defined service area.  Network connections can therefore be planned in
advanced by setting up fixed node locations where needed.  Of course, this
would involve a good deal of field work and logistics, but this is where
working in a small town can be an advantage over a larger city where
obtaining the necessary approvals may require years of sustained effort.
 In a small town, it could be as simple as submitting a motion at town
meeting.
   At least, that was the theory when we first explored the issue over two
years ago.  Since then, we've discovered the Commotion Project, started
working closely with the local Harpswell Middle School, and expanded the
focus from vehicle tracking to include environmental monitoring, mapping,
and field data collection.  We managed to get a hold of three Ubiquiti
Routers, and flashed them with a (now deprecated) version of Commotion.
 The hard part came down to finding a site with decent elevation...
  Well now it seems that we've not only found a site, but a potential
partner in the form of the local Community Broadcasting Network!
   Long story short...  The same people who run the community library also
run the Harpswell Community Broadcasting station
<http://www.harpswelltv.org/>.  I mentioned to the station director (who
also serves as town selectman and State Rep.) that we've been looking for a
spot to setup a community wireless network and he immediately replied that
they've been looking to preserve a water tower that was left to the town
when the Navy closed down an old fuel depot.  The water tower is quite
possibly the highest point in the entire town, and situated in the very
center of a peninsula it would have line-of-site for nearly 360 degrees
including a big chunk of Casco Bay as far as Portland!  I attached a .kmz
file showing the towers location and relative elevation in case its
possible to get a line-of-site estimate based on frequency and elevation.
  The tower is also located in the middle of a park created when the Navy
left the Fuel Depot, and it is immediately behind the town fire station.
 Apparently, the town has been looking for possible uses to justify
investing in the upkeep of its structural integrity.  I mentioned to them
that part of the point of CW is to minimize infrastructural requirements,
but it does open up a whole range of possible applications.  From weather
stations, to webcams, to AIS receivers...

  Nevertheless, I made sure they understood that the project does not
necessarily need a water tower to be effective, and even if the town votes
to demolish, the real opportunity in my view, lies in the potential to
forge partnerships within the frameworks of local community broadcasting.
 Especially in the case of Harpswell as they're one of the few public
access stations who actually transmit their own signal (as opposed to
running a community bulletin board through the local Cable Provider).  For
one thing, there's probably nobody more knowledgable about how local
geography impacts broadcast frequencies etc...  But most importantly in the
case of Maine, the community broadcasters have been leading the fight to
defend public airwaves from monopolization, and anyone involved seems to be
an expert in FCC regulatory law.  While I can claim no such knowledge, the
community wireless movement appears to be a natural evolution of the same
local institutions.

  So thats where we stand at present and things finally look to be coming
together, Besides the more technical questions I will comment on
separately, I had some general questions concerning range testing and
community broadcasting frameworks.  Are there any tools or formulas
available to help estimate what the possible range of a Ubiquity Bullet set
up on the watertower would be?  The attached .kmz file should include the
precise geocoordinates and sea-level elevation and I estimate that the
tower is another 36 meters above ground level.  You can also clearly see
the tower from Google street view if anyone wants to take a look.  It would
be great if I could put together a visual approximation of what we could
reach from the water tower vs. another location.
   Also, are there any other use-cases where Community TV-Radio has
embraced WiFi within their existing framework?  What are some possibilities
for further collaboration?  I've mentioned the exciting work being done in
the field of Software Defined Radio and the RTL-SDR
<http://www.rtl-sdr.com/> hacks.  How could we use low-cost, open source
tools to combine the knowledge of the analog radio community (HAM Radio,
public access etc...) with the civic hacking community?

One of the major rappresentative of a charity association , who understand the potential of mesh networks for local community,has decided to fund the activity for the installation of the first two Commotion nodes in Fano.I have already submitted the budget(very helpful the post on Commotion blog) for the start-up and current expenses.

The main objective is to define a platform(the Commotion wireless network and some applications) to collect and share the data related to the activity of the charity association.
For example, the list of all the goods available and the goods missing.The addresses and phone numbers of the persons who have been supported by the association:divorced women and men,people who have lost the job,people who cannot pay for the gas electricity bill.....
Furthermore,we want to make available a local blog where the local community can share ideas and opinions and in parallel give the possibility,through the same network,to have the access to Internet.

We will keep updated through the digital stuart Facebook page when the first installation will be done,with all the pictures and comments.
Of course if we need you support we will contact you.
To close this long letter,I want to share with you also the possibility we are evaluating,to have funds from European Community for activity who improve the social integration  and social improvements.
Could be interesting to know if we can cooperate on this and share ideas with you and our friends in of Mesh Sayada Community in Tunisia.

236,Commotion-discuss, Can't get past luci admin page,"Tue, 24 Jun 2014 10:49:06 -0400",-0400,Dan Staples,"Hi Andrew,

It sounds like you have a lot of great opportunities and resources in
your area! And that water tower sounds like the perfect place to be a
connecting point for nodes in the area.

As far as the Ubiquiti bullet goes, it's a very powerful radio (up to
6-7 watts), and you can attach a high-gain external antenna, either
directional or omni. Since the water tower is at a high elevation, it
might make more sense to put more than one bullet on there with
directional antennas covering slices of the area. But that's a better
question for a wireless/radio engineer, like maybe someone involved in
the radio broadcasting in your town. I'm also CCing Andy Gunn, who has
lots of knowledge in that area.

As for use cases where community radio/TV has worked with WiFi, I'm
going to have to defer to others who know more about that than I do.

Please keep us updated on your efforts!

238,Commotion-discuss, Can't get past luci admin page,"Tue, 24 Jun 2014 16:11:17 -0400",-0400,Andy Gunn,"Hey Andrew (and Dan) - a few thoughts on this, below.

First - the Ubiquiti Bullet and PicoStation units share similar
hardware, but are only 28dBm output (for 2.4GHz band), so it is about
640mW (0.64 watts), not a full 6 watts. That would be over the FCC spec!

I would also always recommend going with MIMO (multiple input, multiple
output) devices these days. Bullets and PicoStations are single-stream
devices, which limits their throughput. In addition, MIMO devices are
somewhat more resilient to interference and actually benefit from
multipath (signal reflections).

For your use case of fleet tracking, I think it makes sense to use a
900MHz system rather than 2.4GHz or 5GHz. 900MHz (and lower) is much
less reliant on line-of-sight connections.

Ubiquiti does make both a NanoStation Loco M900 and Rocket M9, with a
few antennas for the latter. They will be slightly more expensive than
the 2.4GHz equipment, but may work better in your scenario. These would
be what I would recommend for your base station on the water tower.

http://www.microcom.us/rocketm9.html
http://www.microcom.us/am9m13.html

For the mobile stations, I think you would need to make more of a custom
solution. A MicroTik board with a 900MHz mini-PCI card would work, and
can use any sort of 900MHz whip antenna for a vehicle.

Disclaimer: To do this with non-2.4GHz or 5GHz equipment, you will need
to build custom Commotion images or modify existing configurations, as
we haven't tested the software with 900MHz devices. The wireless
configurations will need to be changed for that before installation, as
the setup wizard will choke on the 900MHz radios, I think.

First, This has not been covered in the listserv before. There are only
some config files relating to zabbix that have been discussed.

The bigger problem is that it looks like lists.chambana.net listservs
have been removed from a variety of search engines (google & duckduckgo
included.) This means that there is no accessable way to search the
archives currently.

The only search that I found that indexed it still was ixquick. But,
they last indexed the listservs in 2012.

We should add an on-site search option for the lists until we get this
figured out. Does mailman 2  have search built in?

devices, and how we have discussed that it isn't necessarily the best idea.

The problem with Ubiquiti devices is that they don't have a large amount
of memory to store the data for QoS, so as traffic gets heavier,
performance can take a big hit. This is just a guess, but I wouldn't
enable QoS in OpenWRT or Commotion on any device that has less than 64MB
of RAM (not flash). Just for reference, the Ubiquiti PicoStation M and
NanoStation M routers we have used for building our test networks have
only 32MB of RAM. Ubiquiti Rocket M series devices have 64MB of RAM though.

As we work towards supporting more router models, QoS performance
impacts will be something worth testing.

I wanted to mention this on the list (and I believe others have
mentioned it in the past - Ben I'm looking in your direction), and ask
what QoS or rate limiting folks are doing on their networks, and how
well does your solution work?

operated by a solar panel and some small SLA or lithium batteries. I have
been looking around for low cost solar chargers that incorporate ""smart
charging"" capabilities combined with data logging and network-ability.

Does anyone know of any small, low cost, weatherproof solar chargers that
can charge a single sealed lead acid battery, lithium ion, or similar
battery? Something that also incorporates a small data logging memory that
can be accessed and visualized remotely over a network connection?
Something that is HTML so it can be viewed in a webpage on any platform?
Maybe even email alerts to alert when the system requires maintenance?

Like I said, the routers would be located in difficult to reach and remote
locations and should be stand alone and off the grid. I need a way to keep
an eye on the system without being physically present unless absolutely
necessary. Ideally the only malfunction that should occur would be a
failing battery and would need to be continuously monitored for the
continued safety and security of the community.

I'd like to avoid building my own chargers unless there is no commercially
viable and inexpensive solution.

Any comments, thoughts, suggestions?

thanks,

to Commotion, that serves ~100 people daily, would be to focus on how many
mesh nodes you would need to deploy.  Likewise, since there is no way to
fit 2000 users on a single 2.4GHz channel, you would be needing to segment
such a large deployment into pocket meshes, e.g. a handful of nodes in each
mesh, with adjacent meshes programmed to non-overlapping channels.
Backhaul between these pocket meshes could be done with 5.8GHz radios, or
wired backhaul depending on your situation.

To help with estimating how many nodes you'd need, it's fair to assume each
node could only support up to 5 (or possibly 10) simultaneous clients
before either the node itself exhausts its RAM (only 32Mbytes onboard
memory) or before the particular channel used by that ( node + its
neighboring nodes + all clients ) becomes saturated.

Thank you for your feedback. We will review our overall deployment design.

Here is some additional information. We will build a customized node. The
prototype is using a dual core ARM cpu with 2GB ram, gigabyte Ethernet as wired
backhaul. We will hookup USB WiFi dongle to service the clients.

We do plan to test wireless backhaul and probably run it on 5.8GHz radios.

Right now the design call for each node to support 30 to 50 clients. We
will try to find out what kind of usage scenario is possible. Data only?
with voice? with video? How will transfer large data affect the performance?

Cheers,
Paul

If it is necessary, we can use quad cores or 8 cores ARM CPU.

USB dongle itself will presumably only talk at USB 2.0 speeds and not
utilize 3.0 anyway.  You would need a dongle that is advertised at USB 3.0

mini-PCI would probably offer better options for adequate bus speed +
sufficient driver support.

The reason that we consider these new ARM boards and USB 3.0 WiFi dongle
because they are cheap and we might be able to use 802.11ac as backhaul. We
are very cost driven but we want to get the best performance that we can

have to use a few products to accomplish this task, or plan on spending
quite a bit for a higher-end charge controller.

Just a note: I'm not a solar expert, but I did do a stint as an
electrician, working on solar installations along with the usual
residential stuff. I am more of an expert on remote monitoring,
instrumentation and control from my time working in radio, where remote
control of distant transmitter sites is a must.

That said, I was able to find a charge controller from a company I have
actually heard of that has Ethernet access and some semblance of control
over the web. Note: I have not used this controller before, so I can't
speak to it's features:
http://www.midnitesolar.com/productPhoto.php?product_ID=331&productCatName=Charge%20Controllers%20-%20Classics&productCat_ID=21&sortOrder=5&act=p

Obviously, it's not cheap, so that doesn't fit your low cost need. My
suggestion is to use an off-the-shelf charge controller, and combine it
with a remote monitoring sensor or remote control unit that you can
program to monitor voltages, temperatures and use internal relays to
reboot or disconnect equipment.

Some examples of lower cost PWM charge controllers are here:
http://www.solar-electric.com/stpwmchco.html
(Though PWM are not the most efficient charge controllers, they are
lower cost)

A company called Control By Web has a series of very good remote control
units with web interfaces:
http://www.controlbyweb.com/products.html

While they are not exactly cheap, they are robust and some have multiple
features. They are also small, DIN rail mountable, and low power. My
recommendation is the X-320, though it might be overkill:
http://www.controlbyweb.com/x320/

If you have more time on yours hands, something like an Arduino or
Raspberry Pi can be set up to take in voltages or sensor data on the
analog inputs, control external relays, and is fully programmable. I'm
not an expert with those, so I am only speculating, but I think would be
able to serve your purpose very well.

Sorry I don't have a magic bullet, but I'm hoping someone out there is
working on one!

way to set up something close to what you want for showing when a router
is meshed. I'm not sure how to indicate that a router has a gateway
connection in a simple way, it seems like the scripts Seamus mentions
might be the only way.

If you go to the menu that you indicated, and add an LED state:
1. Select the LED you want, ""ubnt:red:link:1"" for instance for the red
light.
2. Select the ""netdev"" trigger
3. Select the device ""wlan0-1"" for the mesh interface
4. Select ""transmit"" or ""receive"" as the trigger mode.

Repeat for the other trigger mode, so you have both transmit and receive
tied to separate LEDs (say orange and red, or orange and another green
light).

Save and apply. You should see the light flash for traffic in the
particular direction indicated (received or transmitted), which can
indicate mesh traffic. If it isn't meshing, you will see no traffic!

I know it isn't exactly what you were looking for, but it can be helpful
for seeing the mesh in action.

router models and would love to hear from the community on this list

I've put together a summary blog post with more info:
http://commotionwireless.net/blog/2014/05/13/little-box-of-routers/

With our upcoming point release (Commotion Router 1.1), we'll be adding
supported images for several routers:

- TP Link WDR4300
- Mikrotik RB411AH
- Buffalo G300NH
- Buffalo AG300N

In general, Commotion Router has these system requirements:

- Wireless chipset (target) is ar71xx or atheros
- The router has greater than 4MB of flash
(4MB is recommended for optimal support - we're working on images for
the many routers with 4MB of flash memory)
- The router supports OpenWRT 10.x Attitude Adjustment or greater

But much more effort has been spent  to create a community and spread around
the idea of your project.
This has been much more difficult that the technical evaluation of the

this:time,meeting,money,advertisements,for months and months.
I have already showed to team how the commotion wireless mesh works and 
I have used MediaGrid installed on a mini server (raspberry).
The outcome of this?
The boys have bought the Raspberry by their own and have created a 
facebook page:

local church contacted me saying that he wants to support the project.
This is a great start,because ,soon lot of people in the city will talk 
about this project and you.
I have called this approach ""Internet at Km 0"" where,with this, I mean 
that the data and the network are used  by the local community who 
created them and therefore own them.

I have learned a lot from you and this is the key point I have got form 
your experience.
But I have talked a lot and I go directly to the point.
Few questions.
a)I'm going to invest in Commotion Wireless :How long the 
CommotionWireless project will be supported by you(OTI,)?
I would like to avoid that I start with your solution and after 1 year 
all will be shutted down.
b)I need to understand better which effort has to be done to be in the
condition to modify commotion software and develop specific applications
for the community.This will not done tomorrow,but I want to create some
local competencies for developing applications and support software
development .We need to go by our legs.
In other words:how did you reach the competences you have now?
Which are your suggestions?
c)For planning and installing the network I need really your support.
I can follow the guidelines on Commotion web site ""Get started"".
But it is save to have the final approval from who has already 
implemented successfully the network several time.
I saw the second Commotion node installed by Dan in Baltimore!

286,Commotion-discuss, Battlemesh talk about mesh-wide channel hopping,"Mon, 19 May 2014 16:23:11 -0500",-0500,Ben West,"Simon Wunderlich gave a talk at this year's Battlemesh about progress in
implementing DFS (dynamic frequency selection) in mesh networks, whether
through user-space tools or in kernel space.

http://www.battlemesh.org/BattleMeshV7/Agenda?action=AttachFile&do=view&target=2014-05-17_wbmv7_DFS.pdf

The intended application from Simon's perspective is to permit automated
channel hopping for meshes, as required for operating on those 5.8GHz bands
shared with radar installations.  Although his talk focused on the EU
regulatory environment, the incentives for using these channel in the US
would be similar (avoiding otherwise crowded channels).

My understanding is that the FCC presently requires unlicensed 5.8GHz
radios operating on these channels to be be able to sense the present of
radar and hop to another channel, and Ubiquiti stock firmware for their
AirMAX products (e.g. Nanostation M5) now does this.  W/r/t running adhoc
networks on DFS channels, I'm not sure if the FCC explicitly forbids
beaconing, or if radios may sample the band for 30secs before sending out
beacons.  The FCC regs may be vague on this detail right now.

I'm pointing out this particular talk, however, because the ability for a
mesh to reliably channel-hop would also be *very useful* for 2.4GHz
meshes.  That band now sees potentially destructive noise from
channel-hopping neighbors, i.e. one day your mesh works, the next day it
doesn't.  Manually keeping up where a clear channel happens to be becomes
increasingly untenable.

Any high-level thoughts about mesh-wide noise sensing and channel hopping
schemes for a platform like Commotion?

initially thinking you were looking at an inexpensive 'dumb' charge
controller that did not have its own monitoring output ports.  With such a
charge controller, the battery voltage could be wired to A/D terminals on
some sort of inexpensive GPIO breakout peripheral connected to a USB host.
(I.e. an rPi, the USB port on a Rocket).

Besides having (somewhat crude) battery voltage monitoring via an
inexpensive A/D, what modes of active control would be needed for the
charge controller itself?  I do read about desire to power cycle or reboot
equipment connected to the load, which could be done with an rPi and relays.

would yield lots of info about free or occupied channels, although this
would have to be 'out of band' since it effectively disables the AP.  I was
curious more about doing periodic noise surveys using both the 'iw wlan0
survey dump' tool, in conjunction with the link ETX values reported by
olsrd, so as to not disable the AP.

The survey dump could at least help identify those neighbor's APs which are
particularly strong (i.e. sources of interference).  The link ETX values,
along with the signal dB values vs. TX retry amounts reported by iw wlan0
station dump, would give some measure of the current channel's quality.

We have gateways on the mesh that vary by about 10 fold in speed.  Can someone explain if and how the commotion mesh distributes load between the gateways and if those linked to the wireless routers on the slow gateways can expect any speed increase because of the distributed load?
     Using common speed test websites (www.speedtest.net and www.bandwidthplace.com) I see no gain in speed by being linked to the mesh. However, I am unsure if those types of speed tests are appropriate for a mesh network.
     When a gateway goes down, the attached node switches to another gateway to access the internet, as it should. But I can't see evidence that nodes attached to slow gateways receive speed benefits by having fast gateways on the mesh.  Any insights or pointers to, not too technical, documentation?

frequently from folks you approach about hosting Commotion nodes.

293,Commotion-discuss, distribution of load among gateways and,"Tue, 27 May 2014 14:22:11 -0400",-0400,Dan Staples,"Hi John,

As it currently works, OLSRd (the routing program we use) has a
SmartGateway plugin to distribute gateways to the mesh. Unfortunately,
the way this plugin works is to tell a node to use the nearest gateway
it can find, without regard to the capacity or latency of that gateway
compared to others. So, if my node is 1 hop away from a slow gateway and
2 hops away from a fast gateway, it will always choose the slow gateway
(assuming link quality is relatively homogeneous). Bummer, I know.

The good news is that, if I recall correctly, version 2 of OLSRd has a
much smarter way of choosing gateways, that does in fact take into
account gateway characteristics. So once we move to OSLRd version 2,
that problem will hopefully be alleviated.

But for now, we'll have to work around that limitation.

hope that helps!

En Commotion, no es posible para clientes que no estan conectados al

IP desde el nodo, no desde el router ""upstream"".

Si necesitas un configuraci?n en que todos los clientes en la red mesh
se les asigne IP desde un router singular, una red que usa BATMAN-Adv es
una opci?n mejor.

Sin embargo, en la mayor?a de los casos, no necesitas todos los clientes
recibir IP de un router singular. En Commotion, todos los clientes
pueden comunicar a pesar de que reciben IPs desde routers diferentes.

Tenemos configuraciones diferentes en el sitio de web:

A common question we receive is ""What applications can I run on a
Commotion network? How do I set up xyz application?

For instance,
- How do we perform file sharing?
- How do we perform text, voice, or video chat sessions?
- How about mesh email, chat rooms, bulletin board systems, etc?
- What software currently exists to enable the non-technical person to
use a GUI to perform useful functions?

If you have experience or ideas about what applications are useful in
this situation, or are already running apps on a local Commotion
network, please join the discussion.

Part of what we're hoping to address is proving documentation on how to
set up and run network applications on a local mesh network, whether
it's connected to the Internet or not.

Running network applications on a local mesh is very similar to running
applications on the way Internet, and requires at a minimum a server
hosting the app, service, etc on the mesh. That service can be
advertised between Commotion mesh routers very easily so people
connecting to a mesh can find out about the application or service. So
the person(s) running the mesh can put together a server and advertise
the service (websites, chat server, database, etc) to network users. We
hope to have a basic guide in the near future on how to set up an
application server and connect it to a commotion mesh, however there is
no currently an out of the box easy setup solution.

One application that has some level of success on the Montreal
mesh (R?seau libre) is Coquelicot:
https://coquelicot.potager.org/

It allows users to upload large files, which then get automatically
encrypted on the server. The user gets a unique URL/key to share
that file. The file is deleted after a set number of days.

While we would like people to communicate in a true peer to peer
fashion, many users do not have the resources to setup their own
servers at home, so it was a good way to encourage the adoption of
mesh-only services, while avoiding legal issues of hosting other
people's data.

My personal wishlist for a mesh-app would be an easy way to do
backups, similar to Crashplan between users, but free/libre.
Users could select one or many peers to backup with, set space
quotas and encrypt data before sending (ex: duplicity).

I've been thinking about this too, I'd like to have something like
turnkeylinux[1] that's easy to run and without default passwords.

Seems not so easy to run two services on one instance though, so you
might end end up with at lot of servers, virtual or physical...

Perhaps we could create some installer to just tick which services to
install/enable at launch?

Personally, I'd like to have something like tidepools[2] with an easy
install option to grab a map from openstreetmaps.org :-)

These were some of my thoughts and just wanted to post them to the mailing
list to see what others thought. Jitsi, Linphone, and Retroshare would be
computer based, but running advertised web based applications on the node
would also be an interesting route.

I am very new to this stuff, so forgive me if I sound naive. I am so
fascinated with the possibilities for these networks and just can't resist
getting involved. I figure I'll learn along the way.

https://lists.chambana.net/pipermail/commotion-dev/2014-March/001773.html.
I would be curious to know more about the feature.

But FireChat is definitely not compatible with Commotion. In fact, Open
Garden and FireChat are completely proprietary and closed source, so
there's really no motivation to interoperate with them.

Peer-to-peer mobile is certainly exciting, especially on iOS, but
sometimes the excitement overshadows the more important political and
technical details.

It's such a shame that this closed source project is getting so much
hype in the media recently, as some sort of panacea for connectivity and
everything that enables, with little to no (I haven't seen any) talk
about why proprietary software like this is so problematic.

307,Commotion-discuss, A Business Model for Community Wireless,"Fri, 14 Mar 2014 15:25:41 -0000",-0000,Matt Richardson,"This is a long story, but I am putting out this outline of a business model
for community wireless in the hopes that we can actually implement this
somewhere at a scale, and replicate the model to really start making access
to global information an inherent right of all people.

I have been working on this for a while, and have not published it until
this point. But the model has come to a theoretical point where it won't
move without more help or more information. Thanks to all that have helped
on this: Nitin, my Milwaukee geek friends, and Georgia, Greta and Andy from
OTI

START!
I followed a Human-Centered Design process to figure out the details and
cost-recovery opportunity in response to a problem I found in my other
community work: Why do close to *50% of families* in Milwaukee have
computers/phones but *don't have access to the Internet*? Turns out some
families have to choose between food and Internet, so they turn it on and
off or just leave it off.

So I wanted to develop a model that created opportunity but wouldn't be
completely beholden to the whims of a single funding source or shut down by
politics. That means a self-sustaining cost-recovery model. So I got a few
folks together and we did a pilot in Milwaukee. I am proud to say that the
antennae has survived an entire summer and winter thanks to planning
efforts with the OTI technical staff. :)

Here it goes.

DETAILS!
*Position Statement: The best way to empower people is by making sure they
have the information they need and the know-how to use it to improve the
lives of their family and neighbors.*

*This is a validated model with a pilot in place, so we already have lots
of feedback that shows this can work and what is needed to make it work.*

TREND
In Milwaukee, many families struggle to get access to information that can
keep them informed. In addition, many families in the Milwaukee area have
access to technology but not regular access to local information and the
Internet.

PROBLEM
Lack of regular, affordable access to information and Internet technology
creates a huge digital divide for struggling families. This puts their
children at a disadvantage in an economy where technical education is key.
In addition, lack of regular access to updated information on the Internet
does not allow residents to take control of their block and neighborhoods,
which would be more possible to organize using technical tools.

SOLUTION
Provide neighborhood-level information technology infrastructure that
connects residents to the Internet and each another and gives them a
private information portal to organize. Support this infrastructure by
teaching neighborhood teens and adults to support those systems through a
training and internship program that provides technical training.

The icing on the cake is to incorporate a cost-recovery model that allows
the program to flourish without demanding ongoing operational money from
local and national foundations.

WHAT IS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT
With regular access to the Internet, families can save money. The
neighborhood information portal not only allows local community activists
to better organize people to increase public safety, it allows them to more
easily distribute information that helps residents be safer and smarter
about economic, political and social challenges in their neighborhood.

Training local residents to support their neighbors not only helps build
community, it provides essential technical training to areas where those
programs are not readily available.

HOW IT WORKS
We implement a neighborhood portal (using an open-source version of
nextdoor.com called Anahita) to build neighborhood level information
portals. These portals are private and only accessible to local residents
who have a login, allowing them to discuss public safety concerns without
fear of monitoring or scrutiny.

As many households lack regular access to the Internet but have computers
and mobile phones, we would place a wireless mesh network in the
neighborhood using the open-source Commotion platform. A local community
partner would be our access point to the Internet.

To help support and steward the technology, we will roll out a training and
internship program with our neighborhood community partners to train
neighborhood residents to be the Level 1 support team for the mesh and
information portal. In neighborhoods with block watch programs, we work
with those local block watch captains to populate and promote information
on the portal.

FINANCIAL NUMBERS
Here is a link to the proforma. It basically shows that this kind of effort
can sustain its cost, but can't afford to sustain the administrative cost
of someone to run the whole thing. That means (to me) we need to partner
with an organization which has that kind of people power (or wants it).
They provide the administrative persons, the model makes sure there is no
financial drain on the parent organization. My numbers are thought out, but
maybe not as easy to decipher, so please ask questions.

309,Commotion-discuss, track status of gateway nodes,"Mon, 31 Mar 2014 19:33:00 -0500",-0500,john coleman,"We are slowly growing, we will add our 4th node in a couple days. There is a lot of neighborhood interest but we're growing very cautiously.

As we grow, I am wondering how to monitor the gateways to the internet so that when one goes down I can quickly ask the owner to contact their service provider.  An email once or twice a day to let me know what gateways are fully functional or an email notice when a gateway looses connection to the internet would be ideal. Is there software built-in or as a service that could do this?  Any suggestions?

312,Commotion-discuss, Brick or Nanostation?,"Fri, 10 Jan 2014 14:59:24 -0500",-0500,Anderson Walworth,"Hey yesterday I upgraded a Nano on the roof of AMP (via ethernet/web
interface)  from DR2 to 1.0 and then lost contact with it.
I tried to go into TFTP mode (with the special reset button POE) held the
button in for 8 seconds and still no ping. I also had something similar
happen when upgrading another Nano from DR 1 to DR2. In both instances I
only have access to the POE.

I could better troubleshoot if I had physical access but the snow is making
me wait.
Just wondered if anyone experienced this before or if maybe someone quick
remedy.

313,Commotion-discuss, Commotion R1 Changes,"Fri, 10 Jan 2014 17:52:38 -0500",-0500,Dan Staples,"Developers and network maintainers might want to check out our blog post
on significant backwards-imcompatible changes in the R1 release:
https://commotionwireless.net/blog/commotion-r1-breaking-changes

In summary:
* Mesh IP addresses are now self-assigned in the 100.64.0.0/10 range and
all client subnets are bridged and assigned addresses in the 10.0.0.0/8
range
* default adhoc SSID and channel were removed
* adhoc BSSID is now deterministically generated based on hash of SSID
and channel

The blog post explains the details and reasoning behind these changes,
for those that are interested, and also includes info on upgrading
pre-R1 Commotion networks.

320,Commotion-discuss, [Commotion-dev] Commotion R1 Changes,"Thu, 16 Jan 2014 12:04:13 -0600",-0600,Ben West,"Issuing clients a unique IP in the 10.x.x.x space, regardless of the
specific node associated with, could possibly let client roaming occur more
smoothly.  Giving clients their own unique IPs seems like it would be the
logical extension of bridging all client subnets, right?  Likewise, this
could work toward eliminating some of the layers of NAT within the mesh and
lay groundwork for NAT-free ipv6?

At any rate, issuing clients unique IPs is actually what is done in many
conventional hotspots deployments with multiple APs, whereby the APs (all
broadcasting the SSID) are wired back to a central router that issues DHCP
leases to all clients.  That is, Ubiquiti UniFi operates like this, and I
think even the batman-adv routing in Cloudtrax nodes use may also do this
now, too.

For meshing nodes, some non-trivial parts of smooth client roaming would be
factors like ...

0. When a client roams from node A to node B, how to reliably detect that
event and react to it immediately.    hostapd does write to syslog when a
new client associates.  Nodes could poll hostapd via syslog or via wpa_cli
to discover when a new client associates.  Or there is possibly a more
elegant way to trigger an action upon new client association which I
haven't found yet.

1. When a client roams from node A to node B, while retaining client IP,
how to inform node B to begin routing traffic from that client.

2. When a client roams from node A to node B, how to inform node B's
captive portal to *not* redirect the client to the splash page.  Similar to
#1, this could also be accomplished with nodes sharing the list of active
client MACs (perhaps also with an incrementing session time for each
client), so that incoming roaming clients don't get bounced back to the
splash page.  Or, such a list could be used so that every client *does* get
bounced back to the splash page, regardless of how many nodes he has roamed
to, after some operator-defined timeout has elapsed.

324,Commotion-discuss, Fwd:  Local Apps in Tunisia,"Thu, 23 Jan 2014 15:58:32 -0500",-0500,Will Hawkins,"Hey Dan!

Sorry it's taken me so long to respond! To answer your questions about
Open Street Map is a little, er, involved, but Wikipedia is easy :-) I
will take them in the order of easy to hard ...

For Wikipedia, we were given a copy of the data on a thumb drive from a
local user. He captured the Arabic and the French versions of Wikipedia
from a project called kiwix (http://www.kiwix.org/wiki/Main_Page). I
copied that data onto the local server. The best part about this project
is that it comes with its own web server. Inside the package is a
kiwix-serve program (http://www.kiwix.org/wiki/Kiwix-serve). I ran this
on port 8080 and voila! If you are running Kiwix on something Linux-y,
the server comes precompiled so you don't even have to build it.

For Open Street Map, it was a little more difficult. I am planning to
write up a full guide on how I did this, but here is an overview.

The goal was to have data for Tunisia hosted locally and displayed on a
slippy map (http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_Map). I thought
that it would be good to use OpenLayers (http://openlayers.org/) to do
that, which meant that I somehow needed to build up some tiles
(http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tiles). Those tiles are rendered
from the OSM base data (which is XML format) and turned into PNGs
(rasterized).

To start, I used one of the OSM APIs to get the OSM data for Tunisia.
The xapi API (might be redundant) allows you to query for a the OSM data
within a bounding box. See more here:
http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Xapi.

Once I collected that data, I had to import it into a PostGIS postgres
database. This was a real sticking point for me. I used osm2pgsql to do
that (http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osm2pgsql) after I created a
PostGIS compatible database using the instructions from
http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/PostGIS/Installation.

Once I got the data into PostGIS, I was able to start styling the data.
Because that was much more complicated than I anticipated, I decided to
rely on the styling information that the OSM people use to style their
public maps. I got that from the openstreetmap-carto repo on github
(https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto). Using that makes
the maps look really, really pretty.

Once I got Mapnik/TileMill to create a nice looking style, I could start
the render process! I used a render script that I found online at
https://github.com/newsapps/making-maps-demo (specifically the
render_tiles.py file). The rendering process creates a normal directory
of PNG files. (See attached example)

Those tiles are, finally, the input we need for OpenLayers. Installation
of OpenLayers is relatively straightforward and requires simply a
webserver to serve some JS and those PNG files.

Breath.

The process for doing this was only hard when I really had no idea what
I was doing. The further I got into the process, the more reasonable it
seemed. Please PLEASE send questions and let me know if there are parts
of the process (either for Wikipedia or OSM) that I can clarify. I'd
love to help you get this going for your local app servers.

I hope this helps! Again, I'm sorry that it has taken me so long to respond!

Proprietary issues aside, it's interesting. Of course, sharing internet
bandwidth is nothing new with mesh networks; any OLSRd-based network
like Commotion provides internet bandwidth sharing from multiple gateways.

What I'm still curious about is *how* BeWifi pools or distributes that
bandwidth. Unless there is some sort of network coding/multipath TCP
functionality (which would require similar capabilities at the
destination), it is presumably just doing optimized gateway selection to
route a user's traffic to the internet. OLSRd's Smart Gateway plugin
does this, sort of, but without bandwidth measurements AFAIK. Although I
hear OLSRd v2 can do this even better.

Also interesting that it's being piloted in Catalonia...I wonder how
Guifi.net feels about it ;)

326,Commotion-discuss,,"Sun, 26 Jan 2014 12:05:51 -0600",-0600,Ben West,"Quoting details about the actual hardware being built:

""The way Telefonica has made this happen in a practical way is to build its
own routers that can be installed in houses within a neighborhood. So far
these have had to be installed by engineers, but the next generation are
plug-and-play, and eventually all that will be needed is an over-the-air
software update to customers' existing routers. According to Rodriguez, the
software 'creates a mesh to aggregate the capabilities [of the routers].'
Pooling all of the bandwidth from these routers allows anyone within the
network to take advantage of it at home, and they can also connect to any
BeWifi network they come across on their mobile devices when out and about.""

It could very well be the Telefonica routers would do some sort intelligent
repeating or meshing wirelessly, although I'm guessing much of the
bandwidth optimization may be accomplished by ensuring adjacent access
points do not overlap channels or broadcast with excessive TX power.  (This
is because I'm assuming Telefonica provides its broadband service nominally
via conventional wireline, e.g. DSL or cable, and actual wireless backhaul
in such a scheme would be used seldom.)

My question: would Telefonica subscribers then be *required* to use the
router provided, with its stock firmware, per revised ToS?  And likewise
they would be given very limited admin permissions on that device (e.g.
change the SSID and WPA key, but little else)?  I can understand the need
to compel subscribers as such to ensure uniform bandwidth management, but
it still seems like this walks in opposite directions of what community
mesh advocates are seeking.

If your nodes are crashing w/ 15-20 clients, while both serval and
commotion-splash are disabled, that is very worrisome!

I propose to the Commotion dev team that we urgently need to come up
with a way to simulate network load, so we can identify and fix the
causes of these types of crashes. Does anyone have ideas or experiences
with this? Perhaps we can take the technical discussion over to the
commotion-dev list only.

And just an update for you Dan, earlier this week I found and fixed a
significant memory leak in Serval...not sure how much that will affect
the instability we've seen, but we'll soon know with some testing. The
fix will make its way into the nightly builds probably by the end of the
week.

As long as the rest of your network is DR1 or newer, the nightly builds
should be compatible.

running AA r38347 in WasabiNet on Nanostation Loco M2.

That is, using the same ath9k wifi driver and same underlying OS, but
without the Commotion-specific tools like commotiond and servald.  I will
see nodes boot up with ~26Mbytes memory usage and then gradually increase
over the next few days until sporadic nodes start crashing with page
allocation failures (aka memory exhausted).  This all is happening despite
having 3Mbytes of compressed swap space allocated.    When I am able to log
into crashed nodes to inspect, I will occasionally find the current memory
usage to be *less* than the average observed on bootup, along with
~500Kbytes sitting in swap.

This seems to suggest something is very sporadically allocating itself a
large chunk (multiple MBytes), but not residing in memory as such, and
causing other processes to crash in consequence.  I do use the coovachilli
captive portal in WasabiNet, which could be a culprit and thus unrelated to
Commotion, but there could also be an underlying memory leak in the kernel
or wifi driver.

What are thoughts for having crashed nodes try to collect a debug report
about themselves when a crash condition is detected (e.g. no Internet
access, ""page allocation failure"" detected in syslog), and then write that
report to flash somewhere before the node get rebooted by its frustrated
user?

Besides that, do note that nodes with only 32MBytes of RAM, like UBNT
Picostations, are going to have difficulties hosting local apps for many
users.  If Dan Hasting would be able to use an alternate device with
64Mbytes+ RAM, e.g. a UBNT Rocket, Unifi, or even an indoor TP-Link router
(all of which should be able to run Commotion-OpenWRT), that may be a
viable workaround in cause chasing down memory leaks becomes too ornery.

Thanks for offering more detail, especially that you see the nodes
spontaneously reboot rather than simple have services crash.

I would again point out that the Picostations will have a finite limit for
simultaneous clients.  15 to 20 clients is quite a few, each client
requiring a portion of available of RAM.  It may be a single Picostation is
not going to be able to sustain all of them.

342,Commotion-discuss, [Commotion-dev] Memory Issues and Nightly,"Wed, 6 Nov 2013 12:41:01 -0600",-0600,Ben West,"30 simultaneous users would be what I'd expect when using a Picostation M2
just as a stand-alone hotspot, i.e. without having it issue DHCP leases or
do NAT routing.  Because Commotion (and by extension most mesh node
firmware projects) are running additional services directly on the
hotspots, e.g. serval, olsrd, uhttpd, commotiond, wpa_supplicant, along
with the additional virtual wireless interface(s), this will reduce the the
number of simultaneous AP clients per node that can be reliably supported.

10 simultaneous users per node may be a better limit, albeit on the
assumption that additional memory leak fixes or optimizations are done to
shave a couple Mbytes or so off the firmware's current memory footprint.

Again, do remember the underlying nature of mesh node networks assumes each
node to be rather lightweight.  The ""meshy"" approach to supporting many
users is to distribute them across multiple nodes.

You Are a Rogue Device
A New Apparatus Capable of Spying on You Has Been Installed Throughout
Downtown Seattle. Very Few Citizens Know What It Is, and Officials Don?t
Want to Talk About It.

by Matt Fikse-Verkerk and Brendan Kiley

If you're walking around downtown Seattle, look up: You'll see off-white
boxes, each one about a foot tall with vertical antennae, attached to
utility poles. If you're walking around downtown while looking at a
smartphone, you will probably see at least one?and more likely two or
three?Wi-Fi networks named after intersections: ""4th&Seneca,""
""4th&Union,"" ""4th&University,"" and so on. That is how you can see the
Seattle Police Department's new wireless mesh network, bought from a
California-based company called Aruba Networks, whose clients include
the Department of Defense, school districts in Canada, oil-mining
interests in China, and telecommunications companies in Saudi Arabia.

The question is: How well can this mesh network see you?

How accurately can it geo-locate and track the movements of your phone,
laptop, or any other wireless device by its MAC address (its ""media
access control address""?nothing to do with Macintosh?which is analogous
to a device's thumbprint)? Can the network send that information to a
database, allowing the SPD to reconstruct who was where at any given
time, on any given day, without a warrant? Can the network see you now?

The SPD declined to answer more than a dozen questions from The
Stranger, including whether the network is operational, who has access
to its data, what it might be used for, and whether the SPD has used it
(or intends to use it) to geo-locate people's devices via their MAC
addresses or other identifiers.

Seattle Police detective Monty Moss, one of the leaders of the
mesh-network project?one part of a $2.7 million effort, paid for by the
Department of Homeland Security?wrote in an e-mail that the department
""is not comfortable answering policy questions when we do not yet have a
policy."" But, Detective Moss added, the SPD ""is actively collaborating
with the mayor's office, city council, law department, and the ACLU on a
use policy."" The ACLU, at least, begs to differ: ""Actively
collaborating"" is not how they would put it. Jamela Debelak, technology
and liberty director of the Seattle office, says the ACLU submitted
policy-use suggestions months ago and has been waiting for a response.

Detective Moss also added that the mesh network would not be used for
""surveillance purposes... without City Council's approval and the
appropriate court authorization."" Note that he didn't say the mesh
network couldn't be used for the surveillance functions we asked about,
only that it wouldn't?at least until certain people in power say it can.
That's the equivalent of a ""trust us"" and a handshake.

His answer is inadequate for other reasons as well. First, the city
council passed an ordinance earlier this year stating that any potential
surveillance equipment must submit protocols to the city council for
public review and approval within 30 days of its acquisition and
implementation. This mesh network has been around longer than that, as
confirmed by Cascade Networks, Inc., which helped install it. Still, the
SPD says it doesn't have a policy for its use yet. Mayor McGinn's office
says it expects to see draft protocols sometime in December?nearly nine
months late, according to the new ordinance.

Second, and more importantly, this mesh network is part of a whole new
arsenal of surveillance technologies that are moving faster than the
laws that govern them are being written. As Stephanie K. Pell (former
counsel to the House Judiciary Committee) and Christopher Soghoian
(senior policy analyst at the ACLU) wrote in a 2012 essay for the
Berkeley Technology Law Journal:

    The use of location information by law enforcement agencies is
common and becoming more so as technological improvements enable
collection of more accurate and precise location data. The legal mystery
surrounding the proper law enforcement access standard for prospective
location data remains unsolved. This mystery, along with conflicting
rulings over the appropriate law enforcement access standards for both
prospective and historical location data, has created a messy,
inconsistent legal landscape where even judges in the same district may
require law enforcement to meet different standards to compel location
data.

In other words, law enforcement has new tools?powerful tools. We didn't
ask for them, but they're here. And nobody knows the rules for how they
should be used.

This isn't the first time the SPD has purchased surveillance equipment
(or, as they might put it, public-safety equipment that happens to have
powerful surveillance capabilities) without telling the rest of the
city. There was the drones controversy this past winter, when the public
and elected officials discovered that the SPD had bought two unmanned
aerial vehicles with the capacity to spy on citizens. There was an
uproar, and a few SPD officers embarked on a mea culpa tour of community
meetings where they answered questions and endured (sometimes raucous)
criticism. In February, Mayor Mike McGinn announced he was grounding the
drones, but a new mayor could change his mind. Those SPD drones are
sitting somewhere right now on SPD property.

Meanwhile, the SPD was also dealing with the port-camera surveillance
scandal. That kicked off in late January, when people in West Seattle
began wondering aloud about the 30 cameras that had appeared unannounced
on utility poles along the waterfront. The West Seattle neighborhood
blog (westseattleblog.com) sent questions to city utility companies, and
the utilities in turn pointed at SPD, which eventually admitted that it
had purchased and installed 30 surveillance cameras with federal money
for ""port security."" That resulted in an additional uproar and another
mea culpa tour, much like they did with the drones, during which
officers repeated that they should have done a better job of educating
the public about what they were up to with the cameras on Alki.
(Strangely, the Port of Seattle and the US Coast Guard didn't seem very
involved in this ""port security"" project?their names only appear in a
few cursory places in the budgets and contracts. The SPD is clearly the
driving agency behind the project. For example, their early tests of
sample Aruba products?beginning with a temporary Aruba mesh network set
up in Pioneer Square for Mardi Gras in 2009?didn't have anything to do
with the port whatsoever.)

The cameras attracted the controversy, but they were only part of the
project. In fact, the 30 pole-mounted cameras on Alki that caused the
uproar cost $82,682?just 3 percent of the project's $2.7 million
Homeland Security?funded budget. The project's full title was ""port
security video surveillance system with wireless mesh network."" People
raised a fuss about the cameras. But what about the mesh network?

Detective Moss and Assistant Chief Paul McDonagh mentioned the downtown
mesh network during those surveillance-camera community meetings, saying
it would help cops and firefighters talk to each other by providing a
wireless network for their exclusive use, with the potential for others
to use overlaid networks handled by the same equipment. (Two-way radios
already allow police officers to talk to each other, but officers still
use wireless networks to access data, such as the information an officer
looks for by running your license plate number when you've been pulled
over.)

As Brian Magnuson of Cascade Networks, Inc., which helped install the
Aruba system, explained the possible use of such a system: ""A normal
cell-phone network is a beautiful thing right up until the time you
really need it?say you've just had an earthquake or a large storm, and
then what happens? Everybody picks up their phone and overloads the
system."" The network is most vulnerable precisely when it's most needed.
A mesh network could be a powerful tool for streaming video from
surveillance cameras or squad car dash-cams across the network, allowing
officers ""real-time situational awareness"" even when other communication
systems have been overloaded, as Detective Moss explained in those
community meetings.

But the Aruba mesh network is not just for talking, it's also for tracking.

After reviewing Aruba's technical literature, as well as talking to IT
directors and systems administrators around the country who work with
Aruba products, it's clear that their networks are adept at seeing all
the devices that move through their coverage area and visually mapping
the locations of those devices in real time for the system
administrators' convenience. In fact, one of Aruba's major selling
points is its ability to locate ""rogue"" or ""unassociated"" devices?that
is, any device that hasn't been authorized by (and maybe hasn't even
asked to be part of) the network.

Which is to say, your device. The cell phone in your pocket, for instance.

The user's guide for one of Aruba's recent software products states:
""The wireless network has a wealth of information about unassociated and
associated devices."" That software includes ""a location engine that
calculates associated and unassociated device location every 30 seconds
by default... The last 1,000 historical locations are stored for each
MAC address.""

For now, Seattle's mesh network is concentrated in the downtown area.
But the SPD has indicated in PowerPoint presentations?also acquired by
The Stranger?that it hopes to eventually have ""citywide deployment"" of
the system that, again, has potential surveillance capabilities that the
SPD declined to answer questions about. That could give a whole new
meaning to the phrase ""real-time situational awareness.""

So how does Aruba's mesh network actually function?

Each of those off-white boxes you see downtown is a wireless access
point (AP) with four radios inside it that work to shove giant amounts
of data to, through, and around the network, easily handling
bandwidth-hog uses such as sending live, high-resolution video to or
from moving vehicles. Because this grid of APs forms a latticelike mesh,
it works like the internet itself, routing traffic around bottlenecks
and ""self-healing"" by sending traffic around components that fail.

As Brian Magnuson at Cascade Networks explains: ""When you have 10 people
talking to an AP, no problem. If you have 50, that's a problem."" Aruba's
mesh solution is innovative?instead of building a few high-powered,
herculean APs designed to withstand an immense amount of traffic, Aruba
sprinkles a broad area with lots of lower-powered APs and lets them
figure out the best way to route all the data by talking to each other.

Aruba's technology is considered cutting-edge because its systems are
easy to roll out, administer, and integrate with other systems, and its
operating system visualizes what's happening on the network in a simple,
user-friendly digital map. The company is one of many firms in the
networking business, but, according to the tech-ranking firm Gartner,
Aruba ranks second (just behind Cisco) in ""completeness of vision"" and
third in ""ability to execute"" for its clever ways of getting around
technical hurdles.

Take Candlestick Park, the San Francisco 49ers football stadium, which,
Magnuson says, is just finishing up an Aruba mesh network installation.
The stadium has high-intensity cellular service needs?70,000 people can
converge there for a single event in one of the most high-tech cities in
America, full of high-powered, newfangled devices. ""Aruba's solution was
ingenious,"" Magnuson says. It put 640 low-power APs under the stadium's
seats to diffuse the data load. ""If you're at the stadium and trying to
talk to an AP,"" Magnuson says, ""you're probably sitting on it!""

Another one of Aruba's selling points is its ability to detect rogue
devices?strangers to the system. Its promotional ""case studies"" trumpet
this capability, including one report about Cabela's hunting and
sporting goods chain, which is an Aruba client: ""Because Cabela's stores
are in central shopping areas, the company captures huge quantities of
rogue data?as many as 20,000 events per day, mostly from neighboring
businesses."" Aruba's network is identifying and distinguishing which
devices are allowed on the Cabela's network and which are within the
coverage area but are just passing through. The case study also
describes how Cabela's Aruba network was able to locate a lost
price-scanner gun in a large warehouse by mapping its location, as well
as track employees by the devices they were carrying.

It's one thing for a privately owned company to register devices it
already owns with a network. It's another for a local police department
to scale up that technology to blanket an entire downtown?or an entire city.

Aruba also sells a software product called ""Analytics and Location
Engine 1.0."" According to a document Aruba has created about the
product, ALE ""calculates the location of associated and unassociated
wifi devices... even though a device has not associated to the network,
information about it is available. This includes the MAC address,
location, and RSSI information."" ALE's default setting is anonymous,
which ""allows for unique user tracking without knowing who the
individual user is."" But, Aruba adds in the next sentence, ""optionally
the anonymization can be disabled for richer analytics and user behavior
tracking."" The network has the ability to see who you are?how deeply it
looks is up to whoever's using it. (The Aruba technology, as far as we
know, does not automatically associate a given MAC address with the name
on the device's account. But figuring out who owns the account?by asking
a cell-phone company, for example?would not be difficult for a
law-enforcement agency.)

Geo-location seems to be an area of intense interest for Aruba. Last
week, the Oregonian announced that Aruba had purchased a Portland
mapping startup called Meridian, which, according to the article, has
developed software that ""pinpoints a smartphone's location inside a
venue, relying either on GPS technology or with localized wireless
networks."" The technology, the article says, ""helps people find their
way within large buildings, such as malls, stadiums, or airports and
enables marketing directed at a phone's precise location.""

How does that geo-location work? Devices in the network's coverage area
are ""heard"" by more than one radio in those APs (the off-white boxes).
Once the network hears a device from multiple APs, it can compare the
strength and timing of the signal to locate where the device is. This is
classic triangulation, and users of Aruba's AirWave software?as in the
Cabela's example?report that their systems are able to locate devices to
within a few feet.

In the case of large, outdoor installations where APs are more spread
out, the ability to know what devices are passing through is
useful?especially, perhaps, to policing agencies, which could log that
data for long-term storage. As networking products and their uses
continue to evolve, they will only compound the ""legal mystery"" around
how this technology could and should be used that Pell and Soghoian
described in their Berkeley Technology Law Journal piece. Aruba's mesh
network is state-of-the-art, but something significantly smarter and
more sensitive will surely be on the market this time next year. And who
knows how much better the software will get.

An official spokesperson for Aruba wrote in an e-mail that the company
could not answer The Stranger's questions because they pertained ""to a
new product announcement"" that would not happen until Thanksgiving.
""Aruba's technology,"" the spokesperson added, ""is designed for indoor
(not outdoor) usage and is for consumer apps where they opt in."" This is
in direct contradiction to Aruba's own user's manuals, as well as the
fact that the Seattle Police Department installed an outdoor Aruba mesh
network earlier this year.

One engineer familiar with Aruba products and similar systems?who
requested anonymity?confirmed that the mesh network and its software are
powerful tools. ""But like anything,"" the engineer said, it ""can be used
inappropriately... You can easily see how a user might abuse this
ability (network admin has a crush on user X, monitors user X's location
specifically)."" As was widely reported earlier this year, such alleged
abuses within the NSA have included a man who spied on nine women over a
five-year period, a woman who spied on prospective boyfriends, a man who
spied on his girlfriend, a husband who spied on his wife, and even a man
who spied on his ex-girlfriend ""on his first day of access to the NSA's
surveillance system,"" according to the Washington Post. The practice was
so common within the NSA, it got its own classification: ""LOVEINT.""

Other Aruba clients?such as a university IT director, a university vice
president, and systems administrators?around the country confirmed it
wouldn't be difficult to use the mesh network to track the movement of
devices by their MAC addresses, and that building a historical database
of their movements would be relatively trivial from a data-storage
perspective.

As Bruce Burton, an information technology manager at the University of
Cincinnati (which uses an Aruba network), put it in an e-mail: ""This
mesh network will have the capability to track devices (MAC addresses)
throughout the city.""

Not that the SPD would do that?but we don't know. ""We definitely feel
like the public doesn't have a handle on what the capabilities are,""
says Debelak of the ACLU. ""We're not even sure the police department
does."" It all depends on what the SPD says when it releases its
mesh-network protocols.

""They're long overdue,"" says Lee Colleton, a systems administrator at
Google who is also a member of the Seattle Privacy Coalition, a
grassroots group that formed in response to SPD's drone and
surveillance-camera controversies. ""If we don't deal with this kind of
thing now, and establish norms and policies, we'll find ourselves in an
unpleasant situation down the road that will be harder to change.""

The city is already full of surveillance equipment. The Seattle
Department of Transportation, for example, uses license-plate scanners,
sensors embedded in the pavement, and other mechanisms to monitor
individual vehicles and help estimate traffic volume and wait time. ""But
as soon as that data is extrapolated,"" says Adiam Emery of SDOT, ""it's
gone."" They couldn't turn it over to a judge if they tried.

Not that license-plate scanners have always been so reliable. Doug Honig
of the ACLU remembers a story he heard from a former staffer a couple of
years ago about automatic license-plate readers on police cars in
Spokane. Automatic license-plate readers ""will read a chain-link fence
as XXXXX,"" Honig says, ""which at the time also matched the license plate
of a stolen car in Mississippi, resulting in a number of false alerts to
pull over the fence.""

Seattle's mesh network is only one instance in a trend of Homeland
Security funding domestic surveillance equipment. Earlier this month,
the New York Times ran a story about a $7 million Homeland Security
grant earmarked for ""port security""?just like the SPD's mesh-network
funding?in Oakland.

""But instead,"" the Times reports, ""the money is going to a police
initiative that will collect and analyze reams of surveillance data from
around town?from gunshot- detection sensors in the barrios of East
Oakland to license plate readers mounted on police cars patrolling the
city's upscale hills.""

The Oakland ""port security"" project, which the Times reports was
formerly known as the ""Domain Awareness Center,"" will ""electronically
gather data around the clock from a variety of sensors and databases,
analyze that data, and display some of the information on a bank of
giant monitors."" The Times doesn't detail what kind of ""sensors and
databases"" the federally funded ""port security"" project will pay for,
but perhaps it's something like Seattle's mesh network with its ability
to ping, log, and visually map the movement of devices in and out of its
coverage area.

Which brings up some corollary issues, ones with implications much
larger than the SPD's ability to call up a given time on a given day and
see whether you were at work, at home, at someone's else home, at a bar,
or at a political demonstration: What does it mean when money from a
federal agency like the Department of Homeland Security is being
funneled to local police departments like SPD to purchase and use
high-powered surveillance gear?

For federal surveillance projects, the NSA and other federal spying
organizations have at least some oversight?as flawed as it may be?from
the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (also known as the FISA
court) and the US Congress. But local law enforcement doesn't have that
kind of oversight and, in Seattle at least, has been buying and
installing DHS-funded surveillance equipment without explaining what
it's up to. The city council's surveillance ordinance earlier this year
was an attempt to provide local oversight on that kind of policing, but
it has proven toothless.

It's reasonable to assume that locally gleaned information will be
shared with other organizations, including federal ones. An SPD diagram
of the mesh network, for example, shows its information heading to
institutions large and small, including the King County Sheriff's
Office, the US Coast Guard, and our local fusion center.

Fusion centers, if you're unfamiliar with the term, are
information-sharing hubs, defined by the Department of Homeland Security
as ""focal points"" for the ""receipt, analysis, gathering, and sharing"" of
surveillance information.

If federally funded, locally built surveillance systems with little to
no oversight can dump their information in a fusion center?think of it
as a gun show for surveillance, where agencies freely swap information
with little restriction or oversight?that could allow federal agencies
such as the FBI and the NSA to do an end-run around any limitations set
by Congress or the FISA court.

If that's their strategy in Seattle, Oakland, and elsewhere, it's an
ingenious one?instead of maintaining a few high-powered, herculean
surveillance agencies designed to digest an immense amount of traffic
and political scrutiny, the federal government could sprinkle an entire
nation with lots of low-powered surveillance nodes and let them figure
out the best way to route the data by talking to each other. By
diffusing the way the information flows, they can make it flow more
efficiently.

It's an innovative solution?much like the Aruba mesh network itself.

The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to requests for
comment.

While collecting IMEI and IMSI data is certainly widespread, tracking
MAC addresses is relevant for devices like tablets and laptops, which
I'm sure the police and feds think is in their interest to track.

I'm not saying it's effective or even well designed, and besides, there
is ample evidence that systems like these and omnipresent police cameras
don't do a damn thing to *prevent* crime or terrorism.

Someone on libtech mentioned that this comes in addition to Seattle's
Trapwire system, ORCA transit pass tracking, license plate readers,
gunshot detectors, port cameras, ubiquitous CCTV, and all the other crap
DHS and co. has placed in every major city in the US like air sniffers.

It's just so sad to see another example of great mesh technology being
put to use in further entrenching the surveillance state.

I'm unclear about how dual-band 802.11n outdoor radios can accomplish much
along the lines of meaningful surveillance all by itself, unless the APs
offer unencrypted WiFi with Internet access as a sort of honey pot.  Client
devices like smart phones are indeed sampling the air for whatever SSIDs
are currently in range, but they're not transmitting unless the user
selects an AP connect to, or unless the phones are configured to
automatically associate with open APs.  Is this actually still the default
configuration of most smart phones, or do enough phones still do it to
justify building a $2.7M mesh network to exploit that?

If anything, the decision to use a mesh of small devices with omni dipoles
might indicate some progress.  The police-funded video surveillance system
going up here in St. Louis are relying on gangly rooftop masts studded with
lots of Firetide radios and 2.4GHz panels pointed every which direction,
for what probably eats up more taxpayer $$$ per unit than the Aruba gear

Besides, phone tracking is conventionally done using the IMEI; the MAC of
the device's 802.11 chipset is irrelevant.  On the post-Snowden assumption
that any carrier data on your phone's whereabouts can readily be handed
over (or has already been handed over) to nosy intelligence services,
having such a mesh network purpose-built to that end seems redundant.

As far as I can tell, it uses WiFi (in what way, we don't know) to do
communications between phones, and has some sort of fancy social
networking stuff.

No indications if it will be open source, or if it will provide anything
more or less than the other wifi meshy android apps out there, but I was
curious if anyone knew more about it.

The mesh here in St. Louis is on the small side, compared to other
community networks mentioned in the article which are 10x larger, or more.
Also, in the past, sudden, unexpected press exposure has sometimes led to
equally sudden floods of emails and phone calls to effect of ""Hey, I live

sinister stuff like ""You're breaking the law!""  Maybe it's just a Missouri

Well, just for the record: I guess I also pointed her towards the same organisations. But it really does not matter.

I had the opportunity to meet ,talk and listen some of you and it was a 
great experience.
I want to mention the moving talk of Virginia Eubanks.
She has really changed my point of view.Thanks again.
Now it is my moment.
I have submitted to the principals of 2 high schools of my own town a 
project to wifi connect the two schools and create a mesh network.
The network entirley created and managed by students.
Of course I'll use Commotion solution.
I had to present the project to the students representatives in the next 
weeks.
I was going to write to this list asking some help.
How can I convince them and give  good reasons to adopt this project and 
show the advantages   compared to the wifi deployed on my town by the 
telephone companies in these days/weeks?
The article ""Home Wireless Network Keeps the Snoops Away"" is of great help 
to answer the question.
Any other suggestion from your experience?

365,Commotion-discuss, concerns about the NYT / mo jo mesh articles,"Thu, 14 Nov 2013 20:02:57 -0600",-0600,Ben West,"Here is the Mother Jones article being mentioned.  First time I saw it.
http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/08/mesh-internet-privacy-nsa-isp

An obvious weakness to this premise of using neighhorhood-wide mesh
networks to preserve privacy is that the underlying reliance on
*wireless*makes the task of eavesdropping just that much easier.  I
believe this is
what Julian Priest was explicitly warning about during his surprise talk at
the Berlin summit last month.

Plus, very few community meshes that provide Internet access are not able
to do much more than the ""last mile,"" meaning they still rely on
conventional telcos in one form or another for their uplinks, just at
somewhat higher levels than individuals.

Better integration of VPN layers could indeed help reduce the vulnerability
to eavesdropping, although that would very likely incur unappealing
performance penalties.  However, there is still the fact you're actively
broadcasting all your data, for any adequately equipped parties (whether
you want them to be or not) to listen in.  This isn't unique, we already do
this compulsively with mobile phones.

I would hope that this current trend of framing community mesh networks as
tools again surveillance doesn't eclipse the parallel motivation of also
building such meshes for economic reasons.  And likewise that it doesn't
distract from the deployment of adhoc meshes during emergencies.

368,Commotion-discuss, Interesting discussion on WISPA listserv about,"Fri, 15 Nov 2013 11:03:53 -0600",-0600,Ben West,"There is an interesting discussion going on right now on the WISPA listserv
(Wireless Internet Service Provider Association) about the hotspots being
hung on coax lines by US cable ISPs like Comcast, Time Warner, etc to
distribute service via 802.11 to existing subscribers.

This was brought about by Comcast's recent appeal to the FCC to free up
more of the 5.GHz band for more ""unlicensed"" use (aka so they can use the
band for cheaper):
http://corporate.comcast.com/comcast-voices/comcast-testifies-to-congress-today-in-support-of-gigabit-wi-fi-2
http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/496570-Comcast_to_Congress_Freeing_Up_More_5_GHZ_WiFi_Spectrum_Is_Crucial.php?rssid=20065

The WISPA discussion archive is only visible to list members, but those
interested should be able to subscribe here:
http://lists.wispa.org/mailman/listinfo/wireless

The actual hotspot being deployed is a product made by Ruckus, which
apparently retails for a thrifty 5000$US.
http://www.ruckuswireless.com/press/releases/20130610-ruckus-adds-zoneflex-7781cm-access-point-to-its-portfolio
http://www.ruckuswireless.com/products/zoneflex-outdoor/7781cm

Much of the discussion on the WISPA lists includes concern over the cable
operators' apparent apathy over the spectrum pollution they cause (possibly
in 2.4GHz *and* 5.8GHz) by scattering these devices all over creation.  It
would seem that ensuring appropriate TX power levels, so that even the
cable operators' own subscribers get good connection to the APs, may not be
a high priority. :(

A potential upshot is that the very high price for the Ruckus unit could be
used by listmembers here for their own funding applications, to the effect
of, ""the cable company pays $5000 for just one of their fancy hotspots!
The same funds could build a mesh across this entire block.""  Member of the
WISPA list have already jumped on this very fact, too.

Things like HAM and military radar will indeed impose external restrictions

in this discussion, namely regulatory agencies like the FCC, cable
operators, and the chipset manufacturers, are also probably going to be the
least responsive to community-based concerns.  This will place burden on
small scale WISPs, community meshes, and other groups dependent on
unlicensed spectrum for their backhaul, to be especially attentive to their
antenna gain and local noise floor, i.e. to better cut through the noise.

Short of any options for lodging complaints with the FCC, should certain
cable operators prove to be especially disruptive in their deployment of
hotspots, one possibility may be to seek partnership with organizations
like WISPA in bending the ear of regulators.  WISPA's membership dues
mostly go toward to hiring a lobbyist or two, for precisely these scenarios.

Well it is clear that the journalist created a sensationalist article, put us all into one box and said ""they work against NSA spying"". Of course that is B*S.
I am not worried about any backlash, but I am disturbed that my quotation ended up in an article which has an overall message that I can not sign up to. 
Currently, these mesh networks would not be secure against any serious attack whatsoever. Nor would the users of these networks be able to handle any targeted attack.
The article is not only sensationalist but also technically wrong.

Not sure what disturbs me more.

24 clients using that node at one time.

To balance out the load/ to prevent that node from crashing I added another
Pico Station to the lab. However I am having issues with clients all
connecting to one node continuing the crashing. Is there anyway to
configure my lab so half of my clients connect to one node and the other
half to other to connect to other node?  All of the PC's are running
windows 7 which I think is making it more difficult to assign them to a

I think that was a misunderstanding. Nobody suggested that IMHO.

> Setting aside the technical mistakes of the article (I can think of nothing in the Commotion software that would protect you much from pervasive surveillance), I would hope that at least some people here WOULD be thinking about how we can begin using the Commotion stack to greater protect users from unwarranted surveillance. Why is that not the case?


I think you need to distinguish between the fact that some voices on this list said they don't like the sensationalist spin of the article vs. the fact that we (well many of us at least) *do* care a lot about privacy, user's rights and IT security. In fact the latter is even my day time job. 

Fact: our community mesh networks will *not* protect anyone in the world at the moment against targeted surveillance or hacking.
Fact: good IT security is really hard. Like, really really hard. Google tried to secure their systems, but it was so easy to p0wn them from multiple angles (given enough money to buy fiber taps).
Fact: many of us are trying hard to make IT security better and uphold principles of privacy.


However, that does not make it our community wireless mesh networks automatically resistant against snooping (""keep the snoops away""). In fact, Wi-Fi is a broadcast medium. They just need a good antenna ;-)
Suggesting in the article that they are secure is a massive oversimplification - actually just simply plain false.


In fact, I'd love to see NSA folks do some code reviews of COMMOTION / OLSR. I would know of no better qualified group of folks to do such a thing.
Alas, you might also get a backdoor this way (as we have seen with NIST).
Too bad. Really talented people. 

My 2 cents,
a.

I did just the same thing last Spring where I work, the John Dewey Academy in Mass.  I wrote an initial blog post about it here:  www.zapatalab.com


My students are in the 16 - 19 y.o. range.  I am the social sciences teacher, but I was  political organizer for years and had some expertise with MySQL and basic web design (setting up LAMP platforms, Drupal, Wordpress, etc).  In spite of my relative lack of tech experience, I have been able to lead the students and they have largely taught themselves.  Some students have more expertise than others, and that has been a big help, but overall I think the project can be replicated just about anywhere.  


So far we have built and a maintained a school-wide mesh network using TP Link routers and B.A.T.M.A.N. protocol, we call it DeweyNet-  it serves as an intranet.  We also created a Linux server with a document cloud (OwnCloud), phpbb (bulletin board), Red Mine (project management), and a wiki.  It?s been up and running for about 5 months now.

 

Right now we are beta testing Raspberry PI-based routers, access points and servers for a completely off-the-grid system.  I am developing a game based on a zombie apocalypse scenario that will teach folks to put up emergency communications systems   I will post more of the documentation for you on the blog.


We?ve managed to do all of this so far with +/- $800.  


Best regards-

Evan

389,Commotion-discuss, Connectivity issues,"Thu, 5 Sep 2013 11:02:25 -0500",-0500,Ben West,"I get that chan.c warning message from time to time with UBNT Nanostation M
radios (and I think also sporadically on TL-MR3020) using the ath9k driver.

This warning doesn't appear to affect connectivity for me, and it seems to
occur most commonly when I issue ""wifi restart"" command.  There is mention
of similar warnings from the mac80211 driver stack on various threads on
OpenWRT-devel listserv, so this might just be an ongoing issue with OpenWRT.

Also, I have so far only verified Commotion's multi-SSID setup works on
ath9k, ath5k, and ath9k_htc drivers (with the latter only supporting *2
SSIDs*, i.e. adhoc + 1 AP).  What hardware are you using?

Dan and everyone - OTI will be releasing some of our ""Commotion

As soon as the guides are ready, we will be sure to send an announcement

392,Commotion-discuss, How do you factory reset a Rocket?,"Thu, 5 Sep 2013 15:15:15 -0400",-0400,Adam Longwill,"This may seem like an asinine question but I'm stumped.

We lucked into 5 Rockets (M2's and M5's!) last week and I'm trying to reset
them to factory defaults. As anyone who has played with ubnt routers knows,
they're finicky about resetting.

What is the actual, honest-to-goodness, guaranteed-to-work way to factory
reset a Ubiquiti Rocket WITHOUT LOGGING IN? I have watched every video on
the web concerning this and read all Ubiquiti's documentation. Doesn't help.

Here's what I do:
Device is off. I hold the reset button in. I power on the device. Releasing
after 8 seconds is supposed to put it in TFTP mode. Releasing after 15
seconds resets it completely.

The thing is, neither of these amount of times actually resets it and I
can't ping it when the lights are blinking 1 and 3 then 2 and 4. Upon power
cycling the router, the old SSID pops up on my wifi network monitor. It's
been rather frustrating. Can anyone shed some light on how to reset a
Ubiquiti rocket without logging in and resetting it?

Thank you!

If you are able to get the unit into TFTP mode (i.e. it responds to ping at
address 192.168.1.20), you can effect a factory reset by then simply
uploading an image to reflash it, whether with stock UBNT firmware or
OpenWRT/Commotion.

The 2HP has 32mb of RAM and 8mb flash size with some kind of Atheros
chipset, so hopefully it will able to run Commotion.[1]

Anyhoo, the Picostation 2HP would correspond to the ""atheros"" platform (aka
ath5k driver) under OpenWRT, and it will not run the ar71xx images at all.
You would need to compile Commotion-OpenWRT for the atheros platform.

Also, I can furthermore confirm the current generation of OpenWRT Attitude
Adjustment has something wrong with its kernel-level GPIO support that
prevents images from booting on atheros platform, at least on the Engenius
and Open Mesh radios I've tested.  The OpenWRT-devel community hasn't
devoted any effort to fixing this (and they possibly won't, due to these
devices' age).

I've no idea if the broken GPIO support also prevents OpenWRT AA from
booting on Picstation 2HP.  You may need to try flashing AA (i.e. regular
OpenWRT, not Commotion-OpenWRT) on the device first to see if it boots.

408,Commotion-discuss, Commotion Splash Screen,"Thu, 12 Sep 2013 08:24:20 -0400",-0400,Dan Staples,"Hi Dan,

Unfortunately, the splash screen currently requires internet access to
function. This is because the captive portal program intercepts and
modifies responses to clients' DNS requests, and those responses only
occur if DNS servers are available in the first place. With no internet
access, no DNS response, no splash screen.

I have worked on creating a captive portal solution for
non-internet-connected Commotion networks, and it in fact works. The
problem is that there is currently no way to have a router auto-detect
whether it is currently connected to the internet or not, and then
auto-configure its captive portal to do the right thing. If your network
suffered an internet outage, you would have to either restart DNSmasq on
each node, or reboot all the nodes, in order for the splash screen to
continue to function. And then do the same thing once internet access
was restored.

There might be a way to run a script periodically to check for internet
connectivity, and then restart DNSmasq if it detects an outage. I'll try
to work on that and see what I can do.

Do you know what versions of Firefox and Chrome didn't work with the
splash page? If you can find out, I can look into that too.

cheers,
Dan

410,Commotion-discuss, Commotion Splash Screen,"Thu, 12 Sep 2013 11:02:34 -0500",-0500,Ben West,"Hi All,

Is nodogsplash still being investigated as a stand-alone splash page
solution?  My understanding is that nodog would intercept users' port 80
sessions before any DNS queries were actually launched.

I realize the version of nodog available until just recently was lacking
key bandwidth throttling features, but I can share that a new nodog was
released a few days ago.  The Changelog, unfortunately, doesn't indicate
that throttling has yet been ported to the new 3.x kernel.
https://github.com/nodogsplash/nodogsplash/releases/tag/v0.9_beta9.9.8

Anyway, on the old ROBIN firmware, the nodog captive portal would indeed
continue to display even in case of Internet outage, since the portal
content is stored locally on the node.  I had used that very capability to
(manually) adjust content on nodes' local splash page and announce
outages.  This unfortunately didn't work out as a reliable means to
announce outages, since the ROBIN firmware itself would later detect the
Internet outage and disable the nodes' AP entirely (a feature which
couldn't be disabled, and got annoying very quickly).

As for a node detecting whether it has Internet access, I think Freifunk
scripted solution for that in the freifunk-gwcheck package.  Unfortunately,
luci,subsignal.org appears to be down now, so I can't cite the source code.

This appears to be clone:

But that instruction would only make sense if the Internet was down and
the splash page wasn't working, right? So it's another node-by-node
adjustment you would have to make after an outage.

If I understand it correctly, you would still be able to get to a
locally-hosted page or service by entering in the IP address, so we'd
have to socialize an emergency IP address for people to enter in advance
of an Internet outage, the way people in the US know to dial 911 in case
of emergency. Or is that not how it would work?

413,Commotion-discuss, Commotion Splash Screen,"Thu, 12 Sep 2013 13:00:53 -0500",-0500,Ben West,"Hi Dan,

I believe ROBIN's trick was to include local hostname entries for the
router, e.g. my.open-mesh.com, in into the node's dnsmasq config.

Likewise, dnsmasq supports storing a local cache on the node, which could
be enhanced/enlarged to ensure a good chance that a commonly requested URLs
(google.com, yahoo.com, etc) has entries in the local cache.  Indeed, the
local cache could also be explicitly seeded on power-up with such popular
entries.  I don't believe the RAM requirements for 150 entries vs 10000
entries in the local DNS cache are that severe.

This might allow nodogsplash to stand a good chance of successfully caching
users' port 80 sessions in the event of an Internet outage and display an
appropriate portal page (e.g. announcement of the outage).

This approach would assume the node normally has an Internet connection,
and that outages are infrequent.

How might I go about adding local entries to the dnsmasq config? Our

I'll look into what versions of chrome/Firefox were giving me trouble.
Not positive but I think it may have been with versions 20 or 21.

Purpose of this test was to verify internet connection of my android 
phone in mesh mode through the internet gateway of my network.
*Setup:* 2  Picostations flashed with default Commotion, 1android (HTC 
Desire) ,1 Linux DeskTop.
N01 Picostation as  internet gateway via ethernet cable on LAN port.


Setting.
-Android :rooted ,ad-hoc mode active,no-encryption,IP static 5.x.x.x.
-Picostations :Both with no-encryption.
-Linuk Desktop:no-encryption,commotion mesh applet used to set wifi card.

No problems with LinuxDesktop.I can connect to internet and the 
applet(mesh status view ,debug log) works well.

Android.
The mesh tether looks like described somewhere in the commotion web site.
I can visualize the link window with  three neighbors,LQ status,NLQ 
status and the gateway icon.
The info window reports the same wifi setting as in the active profile.
Ping works with all the nodes an I can connect the phone to the 
administration page of both Picostation.

BUT.
I couldn't connect Android phone  to Internet in mesh mode.
Absolutely no way.
(in infrastructure mode I can connect and I see the commotion splash 
screen).

Where I was wrong?

Thanks.

Luigi

But that instruction would only make sense if the Internet was down and
the splash page wasn't working, right? So it's another node-by-node
adjustment you would have to make after an outage.

If I understand it correctly, you would still be able to get to a
locally-hosted page or service by entering in the IP address, so we'd
have to socialize an emergency IP address for people to enter in advance
of an Internet outage, the way people in the US know to dial 911 in case
of emergency. Or is that not how it would work?

Commotion's use-case as an intra-net without dependency on global Internet
access, then not having the splash page appear unless there is connectivity
seems like a problem -- but hopefully a problem with an easy solution?

If I am building a network with Commotion on which Internet is an
occasional added bonus, how do people access the network/the local apps
without going to the splashpage?

I also think talking to the OLSR list would be the way to go if you are
only interested in protocol level interventions against DOS attacks.

I also recommend reading (Kim, Yu-seung, and Lee Heejo "" On Classifying
and Evaluating the Effects of Jamming Attacks"") which I have found
useful in my explorations of denial of service attacks. You may also
find something useful in the OLD bibliography I put together for my
threat modelling work.

They do, and I corrected myself in a response which apparently has been 
held in moderation queue because I attached a compiled .bin (as well as 
the config for it).

But Andrew Reynolds has been very helpful in another part of this thread 
already to declare how to build even the DR2 for older picostations, 
from what I saw when reading his posts.

TL;DR? http://a.ludw.se/~mmn/commotion/pico-old/ -> .bin file, OpenPGP
signature by the same key as this mail.

Otherwise here's what I wrote in the last mail, that's stuck in
mod-queue, slightly modified regarding attachments:

Pardon my last mail, I thought the ""HP"" model was the ""M"" model.
Nevertheless, I _have_ managed to compile a somewhat working image for
the older, 180MHz, Picostation 2.4Ghz models. I have experienced
problems with it (such as I can't route to 192.168.1.20 when connected
to it, it may not be as stable in the long run, it's of course slower
etc... but it does do the mesh dance!)

The most important part for building for that platform is making a
proper .config, which is attached and also mentioned further down in
this mail.

The OpenPGP-signed binary openwrt-atheros-ubnt2-pico2-squashfs.bin
couldn't be attached to the mailing list without moderation queue, but
it can be downloaded from: http://a.ludw.se/~mmn/commotion/pico-old/

The md5sum of the .bin should be d312ae227697d2956fa82e3389acce67 and
the signature by my key-id F15FF9EE (which is the same as for this mail).


I can't really remember exactly what changes I had to make in the build
config, so I'm attaching what I remember to be from my latest successful
build (at 8th of July).

Last commit in git for the commotion directory was
111c8cc5b1f2d0af5ab8ba9c23388a2dc71ee427 which seems to reference, in
openwrt/feeds.conf:
src-svn packages svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/branches/packages_12.09 at 36405

If you're trying to build yourself, try the latest versions of
everything and simply replace the 'config' (which gets copied to
openwrt/.config) with my attached pico2_.config


As mentioned, this was compiled at the 8th of July 2013. Maybe
referenced repository trees have been updated since then and fail to
build. Let me know if there are any such problems :)

to DR1 (specifically the Red Hook build), the first update past PR3 in
Mount Pleasant.

The node I updated is a gateway node (connected to a Sprint Clearwire
modem), and it meshes with a node on a community center down the
street which runs PR2 (!)

After updating everything, I checked some speeds. The web speed test
connected to the gateway node only gave about 1.3 Mbps down, but it
functioned fine. I then SSHed in to the gateway node and ran a ping
test from it - average of 116 ms to ping out to 8.8.8.8.

>From there I SSH'ed through the mesh to the node on top of the
community center and pinged 8.8.8.8 from it. It got an average of
about 135 ms out. The average ETX between the two was 1.3.

But when we went down to the community center and associated with its
node, the splash page took forever to resolve. After clicking through
it, no web page would finish resolving. I could ping out to 8.8.8.8
from my laptop while associated, but it varied wildly between 1 s and
90 ms.

My thought is that it is just old buggy software that needs to be
updated - I just wanted to share in case folks thought there might be
something else going on.

Do you use a 3rd-party service like speedtest.net?  If so, you may need to
first check that your ISP's connection to speedtest.net itself isn't having
speed issues.

Likewise, you can try multiple 3rd-party speedtest sites, e.g.

the community center node - I (wrongly) assumed it would be about the
same as before.

@Ben I used speedtest.net, will try others next time.

I have a follow-up to this:

Lacking the admin password to the community center node
(MtPCWN_Paloma), I SSHed in and used the command line to upload the
sysupgrade DR1 Red Hook image to its /tmp directory and updated it
that way. When the node came back online, it had clearly updated the
software. Also:

- It brought up the open RHIWiFi AP, as the Red Hook image tells it
to, but I could never associate with this with either my laptop or my
phone even though I was clearly within range,
- It deleted the MtPCWN_Paloma open AP, but kept the
MtPCWN_Paloma_secure AP online (also couldn't associate with this),
- It brought back up the commotionwireless.net mesh BSSID, but even
though I didn't go through Quickstart and the Red Hook image doesn't
encrypt this, it wasn't associated with the gateway node and I
couldn't get out to the Internet. I tested that by plugging in via
Ethernet.

Now I have the admin password and I plan to go back this evening to
try and finish this. Do you think the problem with not being able to
associate with the AP has to do with upgrading from a late version of
PR2 via the sysupgrade image? Should I flash the factory image, and is
there a way to do this without having to use TFTP mode (that would be
really difficult in this case)?

455,Commotion-discuss, Hardware testing,"Mon, 06 May 2013 10:21:23 -0400",-0400,Dan Staples,"Hi Luigi,

I suspect you cannot connect your iphone to windows laptop because of 
the firewall on your windows laptop. Try disabling the windows firewall 
and see if you can connect after that.

For passwords, both the AP password and the network (ad-hoc) password 
should have been set during the quickstart wizard. You can check the AP 
password in /etc/commotion/profiles.d/quickstartSec and the ad-hoc 
password in /etc/commotion/profiles.d/quickstartMesh. You should only 
need the AP password when connecting with the iphone or laptop.

I don't have experience with WDS, so I'm sorry I can't help you there. 
This might help: http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clientmode

What do you want to test regarding ad-hoc? The routers should be able 
to talk to each other over ad-hoc, so you can try pinging one from the 
other, using their 5.X.X.X IP addresses.

Hope this helps.

I was already registered on the olsrd list and I have forwarded my email 
also to them.
To be honest their answer was to contact you (Commotion).

I think that my problem can be checked easily from you.

More info about my problem.
The Ubuntu is  rel.13.04.

This is what I had done.
After to run olsrd I tried  to connect my laptop to the Picostation  using 
the mesh network commotionwireless.net.

The signal is very good but no connectivity exists .

I tried with the ping command from my laptop but the IP address 5.10..... of 
the picostation is not recognized:unkown IP address.

Therfore one of the possible reason of this,I guess, could be the error I 
have got after thr olsr installation.
I have reported it to you in the previous email.

On the other side if I use the picostation as AP and the laptop as client 
everything is working.Also the WDS.
Also if I look at the two Picosatation as mesh nodes(see the picture) 
everything works.


To summarize:
How can I make to work my 2 picostation and the linux laptop as  part of 
meshed netowork ?

I know that I'm not very precise and accurate, but if I have to do some 
trials in order you can understand better what i'm doing, let me know.

Well, living in a place of great distances, it could ease the start up

I got myself a Picostation, Nanostation and a Bullet. So far I've 
played with the Pico and Nano and will put the Bullet into play tonight 
hopefully (as I finally found my antenna). Besides this I'll see what I 
can do with other OpenWRT capable hardware, like the WRT54GL, WR703N, 
DIR-300 etc, that seem to be pretty common and/or cheap hardware. 
Somehow we haven't found a good use for them yet in the hackerspace :)

There was really minimal configuration, which I'm happy about, for 
setting up the mesh nodes and they found each other immediately. However 
I did have some minor trouble setting up an internet connection (maybe 
future UIs can collect all necessary WAN setup on a single page? or 
perhaps I didn't rtfm enough!) but in the end  my neighbours (50+m away, 
through a couple of walls) being able to surf on my connection with 
relatively good speed.

Next step is perhaps to learn how to build my own images so those 
foreign ssh keys aren't there by default ;)

I'm definitely interested in trying out Commotion on various OpenWRT 
capable hardware and as I understand it, work is being made to package 
commotion to work better as a repository style installation with opkg 
etc.

I'm running GNU/Linux on all my desktop enabled machines, so I'll 
definitely try the Linux client out. I'll scout the sources and also 
have a look at the desktop environment applet stuff (I'm subscribed to 
the dev-list as well).

Thanks for making my experience with using Commotion positive so far! I 
was afraid I'd have to get dirt under my nails just to get it up and 
running to try it out, but this was exceptionally easy.

That project is new to me.

Based on only a cursory look through the repos, it seems like a
cross-platform port of OLSRd with some front end work and maybe a voip

That would make it similar in scope to the PR3 commotion release, but
with a focus on platforms and language (qual) instead of local
applications and security (commotion).

together at this year's Allied Media Conference. For those folks that
aren't familiar with the conference, its an excellent place to come
together with a lot of other individuals and organizations and discuss
organizing strategies for our projects and movements. If you want to
read more, check out the conference web site:
http://amc.alliedmedia.org/

Put it on your calendars! June 20th to 23rd.

The idea is to come together and discuss building and running Community
Wireless networks. What is working for folks, and what are the
challenges? How do we raise funds, or what is the business model in use
for keeping our networks sustainable?

I'm going to reach out directly to folks I have been in touch with over
the past year or so, but I certainly don't know or have contacts with
all of the community networks in the country (or world!). Please pass
this notice around and invite people to the AMC so we can have a larger
and more productive conversation.

You can read the text of what I proposed below, at the bottom of this
email. Obviously this is just a proposal to the AMC, I'm hoping that it
will be approved so we can have the space at the conference.

Just so you all know, there are a number of other wireless and community
technology sessions being proposed this year at the AMC. Please consider
submitting your own proposal if you would like to share your stories and
strategies around your projects:

475,Commotion-discuss, Commotion Developer Release 01 is ready for,"Wed, 13 Mar 2013 19:33:44 -0400",-0400,seamus tuohy,"Commotion's first developer release (DR1) is now available for testing. 
This version replaces our September 2012 pre-release (PR3) and adds 
several new features. Though Commotion developers tested each component 
feature, we will begin extensive pre-release testing of the entire DR1 
suite in the coming weeks. We hope you will join us in testing the new 
components.

Pre-built Commotion packages for Ubiquiti routers and Android devices 
can be found at https://commotionwireless.net/download, with DR1 listed 
under Nightly Builds and PR3 listed as Stable. The download page also 
provides links to the Commotion source code for those who wish to build 
their own packages. We have pre-built images for testing on Ubiquiti 
wireless hardware. The source code includes instructions for building 
Commotion?s test release on other hardware for those that wish to test 
on their own devices.

The DR1 release brings a complete overhaul to the Commotion system while 
still ensuring compatibility with PR3 release Commotion nodes. 
Forward-facing features include a new theme, easy ""quickstart"" node 
configuration, application announcement and discovery, and a one-click 
troubleshooting tool. Behind the scenes, DR1 contains a core Commotion 
daemon and new cryptographic system.

The quickstart tool provides an easy interface for node configuration. 
The Commotion daemon provides a common mesh network management interface 
through an embedded library, and forms the core of future Commotion 
platform development. Commotion's new application suite uses mDNS to 
announce local applications across the network. Users can find local 
applications using the router?s web-based application portal. Node 
owners can easily manage and customize application portals for better 
community application support. The application portal integrates the 
Serval Project's key management daemon, which provides transparent 
message encryption and authentication. Finally, the debugging helper 
creates custom, downloadable documents for offline debugging by network 
administrators.

Each of these tools still requires thorough testing to ensure they are 
both stable and well documented. If you are an interested user, 
developer, hacker, or are just plain interested, we would love to hear 
your feedback. Following initial internal testing, DR1 will undergo lab 
testing on an eight-node physical test environment. Then we will install 
on the Open Technology Institute?s (OTI's) 18-node testbed community 
network. Once the software is deemed stable, we will deploy it on an 
active six-node community wireless network for user testing.

We will update the documentation to incorporate user feedback once 
testing is completed. After the build has been thoroughly tested and DR1 
has become stable, we will update the warning label on the downloads 
page to reflect the capabilities and limitations of this release. We 
will then bring the other Commotion platforms up to feature parity with 
the DR1 Commotion OpenWRT release.

I know some of our Commotion staffers who work closely with the training 
material are going to respond to this as well, but I wanted to shoot out 
a link to some of our early work with gamifying mesh network planning to 
give you an idea of some of the work we have done.

I'll let our experts go more in depth into what we are doing, etc.

482,Commotion-discuss, International Summit for Community Wireless,"Fri, 22 Mar 2013 14:19:25 -0400",-0400,Dan Staples,"Are you passionate about using technology to improve your community? Do
you want to help expand access to affordable Internet? Are you an
advocate for open technology, ICT4D or community-owned infrastructure?

If so, then we invite to you to participate in this year's International
Summit for Community Wireless Networks (IS4CWN)
<http://2013.wirelesssummit.org/>. The Summit will take place in
Berlin on October 2-4, 2013.

IS4CWN is a gathering of technology experts, policy analysts,
on-the-ground specialists, and researchers working on state-of-the-art
community broadband projects across the globe. Above all, IS4CWN is a
community of communities, and the annual summit serves as an opportunity
to share ideas and challenges, discuss policy issues, and coordinate
research and development efforts.

The 2013 Summit theme is community. In the past decade -- which included
the founding of Freifunk <http://start.freifunk.net/>, the birth of the
International Summit for Community Wireless Networks, and the genesis of
major projects including Commotion <https://commotionwireless.net/> and
CONFINE <http://confine-project.eu/> -- the community wireless movement
has expanded substantially in both size and visibility.

But where do we go from here? How can we take the movement to the next
level in terms of technological advancement, community engagement, and
diversity? We encourage our speakers, workshop leaders, and participants
to think big this year and help us grow our community of communities.

Interested? Head on over to www.WirelessSummit.org
<http://www.wirelesssummit.org/>.
Registration is open and forms to submit workshop proposals and
request travel funding are available. Early registrants will receive a
50% discount.

Potential topics include: using wireless for social justice, rural
broadband frameworks, technical developments in mesh networking,
spectrum policy, training communities in technical skills, case studies
of networks, challenges of corporate monopolies, and much more.

This year's Summit is committed to having a diversity of voices and
experience, and we're looking to have a lot of new faces in the room.
Community networks encompass a whole range of social, political and
technical challenges, so technical knowledge is definitely not required.

Access to technology and technical knowledge has been historically
inequitable and remains so to this day. Recognizing this, the
International Summit for Community Wireless Networks aspires to include
participants and speakers from a broad range of backgrounds and
experiences. We seek and welcome diversity in order to reflect the
communities that wireless networks can and should serve, cultivating
expertise, creativity, and innovation. Please join us in creating an
environment of respect, equity, and accessibility at all levels of
Summit involvement.

The concept behind Commotion is to make the barrier to entry into a
local mesh network as low as possible while leveraging the inherent
benefits of mesh networks.

Most existing mesh network platforms require a significant amount of
networking knowledge of users and deployers. A mesh device running
Commotion will require the minimum amount of configuration from the
user. The pre-release of Commotion basically reduces this configuration
to selecting the name of a mesh network to start or join.

No mesh platforms include a set of commonly-used services or services
that are suited to take advantage of the unique characteristics of mesh
networks. Commotion will include anonymization, encryption, and
communication services by default. Commotion distributions for end user
devices will also include a services browser. This tool will display
local services that have been deployed on the mesh network like video,
chat, streaming radio, and any other services that communities choose to
deploy on their networks.

Existing mesh platforms target a very narrow set of hardware, severely
limiting deployment. Commotion already targets the most common wifi
hardware, but will also be available for as many consumer wifi devices
as possible. Commotion will target consumer- and professional-grade
wireless routers, Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and mobile phones. The goal
is to increase the quality of the infrastructure by encouraging users to
deploy Commotion on as many devices as possible.

Dear Admin,
 
I would like to add on to Laurence's request below, besides a non-technical user guide, is it possible to also include a technical user guide?
 
Points to include in the user guide could be
1) what to download and where
2) how to reverse engineering your router or mobile with commotion
3) what configuration is required
4) how to create a mesh network after having a couple of commotion-enabled UE devices
and on to other more advanced topics, but that could just be a start
 
I also like to point out that there are problems with the user login feature on the website, or is that not required afterall?
 
Hope that this does not come across as a demand but rather a suggestion, I love the idea and will work towards creating a mesh network for seniors to save on mobility costs.
 
Thank you,
Vincent

which may be a starting point for you. They are very incomplete right now,
but do provide an overview of where/how to download pre-built images, and
how to flash Ubiquity and Fonera routers.

I'm planning to write up some instructions for this soon. But building an
image with commotion is pretty simple thanks to the included setup script.
I'll post more when that's completed, but basically you customize a config
file, and potentially some other files that define your network, and then
run the included setup.sh script. It will check out the latest openwrt code
through svn, then add in the commotion configs, your custom configs, and the
frontend web interface.

We're trying to cover so much ground that even our more advanced users
are likely to get stuck at some point. My goal is to be able to identify
the common sticking points and give some sort of suggestion even if a
full answer is not available.

My focus right now is on overhauling the project site. Some of the
things I plan to add are development task lists, how-to documents (such
as you've suggested below), and a more useful navigation scheme. We're
also splitting the ""What is Commotion""-type material off onto a separate
site, which should help us organize the technical and non-technical
documentation a little more easily.

In the mean time, please keep sending questions and suggestions to the
list. I want to be sure all of this material makes it to the project site.

489,Commotion-discuss, New here,"Wed, 31 Aug 2011 23:51:07 +0530",+0530,Yann Forget,"Hello,

I am really excited by this project.
I just read two reports on French press about it:
http://www.lemonde.fr/technologies/article/2011/08/30/commotion-le-projet-d-un-internet-hors-de-tout-controle_1565282_651865.html
http://www.lepoint.fr/high-tech-internet/internet-le-kit-anti-censure-progresse-aux-etats-unis-31-08-2011-1368421_47.php

A bit of presentation first.
I am a French computer engineer specialist of Linux and Internet
technology currently living in India.
It remained me of trying to install long distance wireless connection
between Geneva and Lausanne, Switzerland, in 2000-2001, at the time of
the Seattle Wireless debut.
I am impatient trying this in India, both to overcome connection
costs, and the attempt of censorship by the government.

Please keep in touch.

Best regards,

Yann
