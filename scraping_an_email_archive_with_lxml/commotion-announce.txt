Hi folks,

Due to some long-standing issues with gitweb, we're switching to git
daemon to make the Commotion source publicly available. To clone the
Commotion repository anonymously, a user can now say:

$ git clone git://git.chambana.net/commotion-openwrt

We'll publicize repos for other platforms via git daemon, as well. The
websites will be updated soon.

The gitweb web-based source browser will still be available at:

http://git.chambana.net/commotion-openwrt

Brian

I'm behind some pretty sketchy wifi in Detroit right now, which may be the
cause, but I've so far been unable to check out the repo...

bash#~/commotion$ git clone git://git.chambana.net/commotion-openwrt
Initialized empty Git repository in
/blah/blah/blah/commotion/commotion-openwrt/.git/
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly

Anyone else having the same problem?

Hi Ben,

We recently pushed a bunch of updates to the development site, and 
that's resulted in a few issues with the repository handling. Brian's 
working on it and should have it fixed in a bit.

Yeah, this was pretty recent. It was fixed, and then while we were 
trying to fix some other stuff and push general upgrades it broke again 
today. So it'll be working again soon. I'm also nearly finished setting 
up a completely new server that will be a lot more reliable and 
up-to-date.

Hi all,

Apologies for the confusion. Apparently, git-daemon had been working 
until we upgraded to gitolite as our access control method. gitolite 
decided it should have complete control over whether something was 
served via git-daemon, so nothing is currently available publicly. I 
should have it resolved in a few minutes.

Thanks,
Brian

Subject: [Commotion-announce] Commotion Project Site
Message-ID: <4E8B26F3.4050708@newamerica.net>

In keeping with our commitment to make Commotion as user friendly as
possible, OTI staffers have launched a new website focused on
non-technical Commotion content.

The new site, http://commotionwireless.net, is geared toward
journalists, end users, and those who don't need to wade through the
deeper technical details. The original project site,
https://tech.chambana.net/projects/commotion, is for developers and
other project contributors, who need to know the inner workings of the
software.

By separating the technical and non-technical content, we will be able
to tailor each site to the needs of its users, making each more useful
in the process. We will be overhauling the content and navigation of
both sites in the coming weeks, and welcome questions, comments, and
feedback.

From s2e at opentechinstitute.org  Wed Mar 13 23:33:51 2013

Subject: [Commotion-announce] Commotion Developer Release 1 is ready for
	download and testing
Message-ID: <51410CDF.2090108@opentechinstitute.org>

Commotion's first developer release (DR1) is now available for testing. 
This version replaces our September 2012 pre-release (PR3) and adds 
several new features. Though Commotion developers tested each component 
feature, we will begin extensive pre-release testing of the entire DR1 
suite in the coming weeks. We hope you will join us in testing the new 
components.

Pre-built Commotion packages for Ubiquiti routers and Android devices 
can be found at https://commotionwireless.net/download, with DR1 listed 
under Nightly Builds and PR3 listed as Stable. The download page also 
provides links to the Commotion source code for those who wish to build 
their own packages. We have pre-built images for testing on Ubiquiti 
wireless hardware. The source code includes instructions for building 
Commotion?s test release on other hardware for those that wish to test 
on their own devices.

The DR1 release brings a complete overhaul to the Commotion system while 
still ensuring compatibility with PR3 release Commotion nodes. 
Forward-facing features include a new theme, easy "quickstart" node 
configuration, application announcement and discovery, and a one-click 
troubleshooting tool. Behind the scenes, DR1 contains a core Commotion 
daemon and new cryptographic system.

The quickstart tool provides an easy interface for node configuration. 
The Commotion daemon provides a common mesh network management interface 
through an embedded library, and forms the core of future Commotion 
platform development. Commotion's new application suite uses mDNS to 
announce local applications across the network. Users can find local 
applications using the router?s web-based application portal. Node 
owners can easily manage and customize application portals for better 
community application support. The application portal integrates the 
Serval Project's key management daemon, which provides transparent 
message encryption and authentication. Finally, the debugging helper 
creates custom, downloadable documents for offline debugging by network 
administrators.

Each of these tools still requires thorough testing to ensure they are 
both stable and well documented. If you are an interested user, 
developer, hacker, or are just plain interested, we would love to hear 
your feedback. Following initial internal testing, DR1 will undergo lab 
testing on an eight-node physical test environment. Then we will install 
on the Open Technology Institute?s (OTI's) 18-node testbed community 
network. Once the software is deemed stable, we will deploy it on an 
active six-node community wireless network for user testing.

We will update the documentation to incorporate user feedback once 
testing is completed. After the build has been thoroughly tested and DR1 
has become stable, we will update the warning label on the downloads 
page to reflect the capabilities and limitations of this release. We 
will then bring the other Commotion platforms up to feature parity with 
the DR1 Commotion OpenWRT release.

Subject: [Commotion-announce] Commotion DR1.1 Release
Message-ID: <51B5EC1E.5060305@chambana.net>

Hi all,

Now that the download page on the main website is updated, I just wanted
to send out the release notes for our latest point release. This should
be the beginning of a more rapid release cycle. You can download DR1.1 at:

https://commotionwireless.net/download

Release notes below:

Commotion DR1.1 Release Notes

Developer Release 1.1 is the first stable release of the DR1 series.
This release is the beginning of our new stable branch, and represents a
significant step forward from our previous stable release.
What is a Commotion release?

Commotion release versions represent a target set of features for the
entire project
(http://code.commotionwireless.net/projects/commotion/wiki/Official_Version_Feature_Targets).
Software packages for individual platforms (Linux, Windows, etc.) may be
in different stages of development, and are labeled according to their
supported features.
Platform Availability:

Currently, only the OpenWRT-based router firmware is DR1 compatible.
Other platforms are under active development and are being brought up to
feature parity. Current platform revisions can be found on the Official
Version Feature Targets page.
Features:

    Easy-to-use setup wizard: The Commotion Quickstart provides a
simple, one-step interface for setting up a Commotion node.

    Local applications: The Commotion Apps Portal is an interface for
creating and browsing for local network applications.

    Common platform for managing settings: The Commotion Daemon provides
a common management interface for maintaining the configurations of
different community networks.

    Encryption tools: Commotion configures industry-standard IBSS-RSN
encryption by default, and provides the Serval crypto API to aid
developers in creating secure applications.

    Consistent visual style: New Commotion releases are all styled in
accordance with the Commotion Human Interface Guidelines
(http://commotionwireless.net/docs/hig/introduction).

    Simplified debugging: A new Commotion Debugging Helper tool makes it
easy to retrieve useful troubleshooting information from a node in the
event of a network problem.

Fixes:

    Innumerable fixes and changes went into this release since Preview
Release 3 (PR3), the previous stable branch. A complete list can be
found on the Commotion project site.

Subject: [Commotion-announce] seeking input - what additional routers should
	Commotion support?
Message-ID: <53736499.5050001@opentechinstitute.org>

Hello! The Commotion team is working on expanding support for additional
router models and would love to hear from the community on this list
about what routers you're using or would like to use with Commotion.

I've put together a summary blog post with more info:
http://commotionwireless.net/blog/2014/05/13/little-box-of-routers/

With our upcoming point release (Commotion Router 1.1), we'll be adding
supported images for several routers:

- TP Link WDR4300
- Mikrotik RB411AH
- Buffalo G300NH
- Buffalo AG300N

In general, Commotion Router has these system requirements:

- Wireless chipset (target) is ar71xx or atheros
- The router has greater than 4MB of flash
(4MB is recommended for optimal support - we're working on images for
the many routers with 4MB of flash memory)
- The router supports OpenWRT 10.x Attitude Adjustment or greater

We’ve compiled a list of potentially compatible routers on our wiki as a
guide
(https://wiki.commotionwireless.net/doku.php?id=development_resources:router:hardware_compatibility_list)


But we'd also like to hear from you to help focus our list to support
hardware that's available in your area. We'd particularly like to hear
from folks who are not in the US.

If you are interested in helping out and have one or more of the routers
on our list, contact us! We’ll even build a testing image for you if
your device is compatible!

There are a handful of products now sold, similar in form factor to the
small TP-Link routers, with affinity to mesh networks.  They're all quite
OpenWRT friendly, so adding Commotion support could be as simple as adding
another target to the buildbot's runlist.

Mesh Potato v2
http://store.villagetelco.com/mesh-potatoes/mesh-potato-2-basic.html

GL-iNet v1 (this just recently appeared)
http://www.gl-inet.com/w/?page_id=308&lang=en
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JL2AOXQ?ie=UTF8&seller=A364119SDJA4QG&sn=alzhao(8MB
flash)
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JKFE0FW?ie=UTF8&seller=A364119SDJA4QG&sn=alzhao(16MB
flash)

There is also an upcoming product from Nubelium in Spain that looks near
identical to the Mesh Potato v2:
https://twitter.com/nubelium/media

Likewise Serval's Mesh Extender device:
https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/speak-freely

P.S. I have Attitude Adjustment running with USB on a TP-Link TL3420 v2,
too.  Still not doing anything useful with pivot root, tho.

Subject: [Commotion-announce] Commotion Router v1.1.rc2 released!
Message-ID: <539F061F.7080208@opentechinstitute.org>

Hi all,

I'm pleased to announce that we've just posted the second release
candidate for the stable 1.1 version of the Commotion Router firmware.
This version patches a memory leak in our Serval plugin, and also
includes a number of small bugfixes and interface tweaks. You can find
the release notes here:

https://commotionwireless.net/blog/2014/06/13/commotion-router-1.1rc2-release-notes/

and downloads here:

We currently have images for a selection of Ubiquiti routers posted, and
will be posting images for select TP-Link and Buffalo routers shortly.
Pending completion of testing on one of our larger community testbed
networks, this release will hopefully become v1.1 final within the next
week or two.
