Code That Only Does One Thing
=============================

Directories in this repository hold stand-alone code clusters that demonstrate bare-bones functionalities available in Python 2.7, Flask, Django, and libraries intended for use with them.

Generally, a requirements.txt file is included to document dependencies installed on the virtual environment.
